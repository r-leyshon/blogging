For a formal description of the audio feature categories presented here, please
consult the
<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features" target="_blank">Spotify Developer API Documentation</a>.

Overall, a laid-back and peaceful affair, with distribution in the lower
valence and speechiness values. Acousticness and instrumentalness are mostly
confined to lower values, with the distinct exception of the final track, "A
New Start". A broad middle-range distribution in energy and danceability is
common across all tracks.

## Interpreting the Ridge Plot (Click to expand)

These ridge plots show a histogram of the mean audio feature values across each
track in the album. Look across the horizontal axis at where the peaks for each
feature occur. For example, if the album contains lots of tracks with busy
vocals, the speechiness feature will show a peak to the right of the horizontal
axis. Conversely, an instrumental album would have a speechiness peak to the
left of the horizontal axis but you would also expect it to have a peak to the
right of the axis in the instrumentalness feature.

## The Tracks

Below are the mean audio feature values for each track. The last row (green)
presents a mean summary of the album.

```{r}
#| echo: false
tab = create_album_audio_summary_table(spotify_id = album_id)
# create album average
numeric_cols = select(tab, where(is.numeric))
summary_tab = summarise(numeric_cols, across(everything(), mean))
summ_row = cbind(track_name = glue::glue("Album Mean"), summary_tab)
tab = rbind(tab, summ_row)
# Visualise
summ_ind = nrow(tab)
kableExtra::kbl(tab) %>%
row_spec(summ_ind, color = "white", background = "#146542")

## Extinction
The opening track sets the tone with its haunting melodies and pulsating beats.
It’s reminiscent of the Stranger Things theme, yet maintains its unique
identity, aiming for a more subtle tension to emerge.

## Doomsday Clock
From the outset a  percussive metronome  gradually builds tension. A brooding
composition, the synths create an eerie atmosphere, leaving you on the edge of
anticipation. 

## Pale Blue Dot

![Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. (Carl Sagan)](https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PIA23645_PaleBlueDotRevisited_1600.jpg?w=640&format=jpeg)

A beautiful piece that balances melancholy and hope. The delicate piano
interludes blend seamlessly with the electronic textures.

## Fragment
The standout track, this shorter number feels like a glitch in the matrix. Its
beats and fragmented sounds add an intriguing layer.

## New Start
Short but impactful, this track offers a sense of resolution. The uplifting
melodies and arpeggios leave you with a feeling of renewal. Peaceful piano is
used to great effect, a distinct step change to the synth of the rest of the
EP.

## Overall
When Worlds Collide is a journey that transcends time and space. Each track
contributes to the EP’s cohesive narrative, making it a must-listen for fans of
synthwave and ambient music.
