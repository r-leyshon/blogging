## Introduction

4 years into my career in the UK civil service, I am about to move to a new
department and am taking the time to consider successes, challenges and lessons
learned along the way. It's been an incredible journey. I've been lucky to have
worked with some of the most talented people and on some fantastic projects. 

One of my most valued opportunities to learn is in the form of a great book
recommendation, especially when someone has taken the time to get to know the
kinds of books that I would benefit from reading. 

As I anticipate starting in my new role, I'd like to take the opportunity to
pay some of these thoughtful recommendations forward. If you're starting out in
the public sector, or considering it, then you may find some of these texts to
be helpful. Three of the four are open source and free to anyone with internet
access. The books would appeal to distinct audiences, so I'll try to set out
my interpretation of the audience.

## The Recommendations

:::{.callout-note}

### Product Placement

This article is not sponsored by anyone. All of the books here have been read
and integrated into my working practice to some extent. 

:::

I will work through a recommendation for each year of service in roughly
chronological order - no ranking implied. 

### 1. 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey @Covey.

#### Who Is It For? (Click to expand)

Just about anyone. But particularly, anyone whose job affords them the
responsibility of directing their own time. Though there is also a lot to be
applied to your everyday life, too.
