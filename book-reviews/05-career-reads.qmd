## Introduction

4 years into my career in the UK civil service, I am about to move to a new
department and am taking the time to consider successes, challenges and lessons
learned along the way. It's been an incredible journey. I've been lucky to have
worked with some of the most talented people and on some fantastic projects. 

One of my most valued opportunities to learn is in the form of a great book
recommendation, especially when someone has taken the time to get to know the
kinds of books that I would benefit from reading. 

As I anticipate starting in my new role, I'd like to take the opportunity to
pay some of these thoughtful recommendations forward. If you're starting out in
the public sector, or considering it, then you may find some of these texts to
be helpful. 

Some of the books will be useful to a broad audience of civil servants, though
others may be more relevant to those who program as part of their job.

## The Recommendations

:::{.callout-note}

### Product Placement

This article is not sponsored by anyone. All of the books here have been read
and integrated into my working practice to some extent. 

:::

I will work through a recommendation for each year of service in roughly
chronological order - no ranking implied. Three of the four recommendations are
open source and free to anyone with internet access. The books appeal to
distinct audiences, so I'll try to set out who I think will find the content
useful.

### 1. 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey @Covey.

#### Who Is It For? (Click to expand)

Just about anyone. But particularly, anyone whose job affords them the
responsibility of directing their own time. Though there is also a lot to be
applied to your everyday life, too.

:::

I have a bit of a long history with this book. I was initially recommended it
when working as a high school science teacher as part of a training event. For
some curious reason I found myself resistant to picking it up. I think I felt
too busy to dedicate myself to much reading in general at that point in my
career and in retrospect, that was a mistake. This book has lots of really
useful, actionable guidance for doing more of what matters most.

Starting from a point of personal effectiveness will set you up for success in
the civil service, particularly as you develop proficiency in this skill, you
may be expected to extend this effectiveness to others through the management
of people and projects. 

The highlight of the book for me is the famous Covey Quadrant:

<img alt="Covey quadrant, creative commons." src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/7_habits_decision-making_matrix.png/596px-7_habits_decision-making_matrix.png?20181120003806" width="400" class="center">

This was adapted from the Eisenhower Matrix, named after the former president
who had devised the rubrik. Covey's guidance on the matter was to spend time
at the start of the day (or even better, at the end of the previous day)
triaging your tasks against the dimensions of urgency and importance. And to be
mindful that the everyday pressures may push you towards quadrant 1, while the
most effective use of your time is generally within quadrant 2.

This approach seemed revalatory to me at the time of reading and would have
certainly helped during the early stages in my education career. I readily
applied this approach from the outset of my civil service career as a financial
analyst and then later data science lecturer. As I progressed to managing a
faculty of data science lecturers, I had spotted a team in another government
department using an interactive team Covey Quadrant. This was a great
opportunity to trial the approach with the faculty, who were extremely busy
delivering technical training across public sector bodies while also needing to
iterate and improve on the service offering. 

`<INSERT IFRAME OF DUMMY BI TOOL>`

This tool was exceptionally useful in helping manage demand on the team.
Conversations about feasible turnaround and how incoming priorities compared to
pre-existing work were well-informed by a quick weekly update to the
dashboard's data (nothing more than updating a couple of columns in an Excel
spreadsheet). This tool became my indespensible buddy during that period of
high demand and I would thoroughly recommend taking the time to put something
similar together if you find your team is in a similar situation.

### 2. Agile DSDM Project Framework
