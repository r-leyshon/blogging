## Introduction

As of today's date, Algorithms to Live By (AtLB) scores an average of
4.13 / 5.00 across over 2.5k ratings on
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25666050-algorithms-to-live-by).

AtLB made the [MiT Technology Review Best Books of 2016](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/12/23/243930/best-books-of-2016/) and [Forbes' Must Read Brain Books](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2016/12/19/the-best-brain-books-of-2016/) of the same year.

## Summary

AtLB is a fantastic read for those naive to the complexity of computer science
and how it can be applied to everyday life. From deciding whether to try a new
restaurant, how best to go about finding your next home to optimising your
socks draw. It turns out, the big brains in modern history have already solved
these problems. The authors take us through the surprising implications that
computer science can have for how we muddle through things, keeping things
light and accessible enough to be categorised under popular science. Though the
authors manage not to undersell sell the impact and after reading this book,
you will never think about sorting in the same way again.

### On the Authors

Tom Griffiths is a celebrated Princeton professor in computational cognition
and director of the University's Computational Cognitive Science Laboratory
 @PrinceCCSL. The recipient of numerous awards and a leader in applied
 artificial intelligence research, Griffiths has many influential papers across
 a diverse set of problem spaces: Causal inference, natural language
 processing and pedagogy.

 Brian Christian has written several award winning works of non-fiction,
 notably "The Alignment Problem" which examines machine learning ethics, for
 which he received numerous awards. A visiting scholar at the University of
 California, Berkeley; Christian's expertise ranges from programming to poetry,
 earning his laureate at San Francisco Public Library in 2016.

## An Overview of the Book

Each of the book's eleven chapters focusses on a specific problem set and the
algorithms that have been developed to help overcome them. The problem domains
explored range from the superficially 'simple' optimised sorting of returned
library books to the profound insights that behavioural economics can yield in
the chapter on game theory. There is a general trend within the chapters'
progress towards problems of higher complexity. The authors have provided a
wealth of relatable examples of problem applications throughout the entire
book, limiting the use of equations to only a few occasions. This is not a book
aimed exclusively at a highly numerate audience.

In the sections below, I will explore some of the more engaging aspects of the
book's content.

### A Gentle Introduction to Operational Research

The authors cater for my (and possibly the larger portion of their audience's)
needs by tackling some rather large misconceptions about computer science and
human behaviour. Namely that humans are far too fuzzy-minded, fallible and that
the real world is far too complex to benefit from optimisation. Indeed, the
authors do state that some problems are known to be intractible due to a near
infinite number of potential solutions, however those problems can be defined
from the outset. And the rest of life's challenges may often be reduced to
outcomes affected by chance - the search for the right New York apartment being
the particular focus for the intro. Briefly introducing the optimal stopping
problem of whether to put an offer in for an apartment or to risk losing out on
possibly the best apartment on the market by continuing your search provides an
accessible and familiar insight to the direction of the book.

"...spend 37% of your apartment hunt (eleven days, if you've given yourself a
month for the search) noncommittally exploring options. Leave the checkbook at
home; you're just calibrating. But after that point, be prepared to immediately
commit - deposit and all - to the very first place that beats whatever you've
already seen." [@AtLB, p.2]
:::

At that point, the authors hit the reader with a little taste of the magic in
this book - that this problem is in many ways solved. That this same type of
solution can be applied to a rane of real world problems from parking your car
to choosing a long-term partner, the concept that there exists a proof that
at 37% of your search time you should immediately flip to committing has an
almost Douglas Adams sort of quality to it.

### Optimal Stopping

Chapter 1 of the book dedicates more to explaining the debated origins of what
has become known as 'The Secretary Problem' - a common description of the 
Catch-22 described in the introduction. In the context of hiring an employee
for example, hiring at random regardless of the candidate's performance from a
pool of 100 candidates would result in success for the employer on average 1%
of the time. Success meaning that the employer has selected the best applicant
from the pool.

By following the optimal stopping strategy, the average chances of hiring the
best candidate within the pool increases to 37%. Whether or not you feel that
is a good outcome is sort of subjective, but the authors discuss that this
outcome remains stable as you scale up the applicant pool while random
recruitment does not - interviewing a million candidates while observing
optimal stopping should bag you the best candidate on average 37% of the time.
Random recruitment however, would result in successful recruitment of the
strongest candidate in 0.0001% of the time. 

The example of scaling up this problem prompted me to consider some
potential flaws in human behaviour, that would render any recruitment campaign
unfair - optimised or otherwise. Standardising the recruitment process is known
to be extremely challenging. Treating the problem like trial design,
controlling for factors quickly results in confounding variables. If choosing
to minimise variation in the appraisal process, you may consider
retaining the same panel for each interview. Ensuring that the panel's
sattention and mood are not affected by a demanding interview schedule becomes
the next problem. Attempting to control for that results in extending the
schedule period, possibly from days to months.

performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another
class" @NFLTheorem
:::

The secretary problem presumes that the information available to the
interviewer about the quality of the candidates is relative rather than
absolute. You can compare or rank the candidates but do not have a list of
absolute criteria or aptitude tests to measure your candidates against. Any
such approach to interviewing would swiftly be decried for lacking any
objective threshold, leaving the entire process wide open to human bias. 

Another assumption of the secretary problem is that making an offer would
guarantee the candidate would accept, while passing up on a candidate would
result in losing out on the possibility of recruiting that candidate forever.
Few recruitment campaigns could operate under such conditions, however these
assumptions could hold more relevance to scenarios such as selecting a parking
space or selecting a long-term partner. Possibly. Although humans are complex
organisms, the motivations driving that behaviour may lead to stable,
predictable outcomes when considering a larger sample size. 

Overall, I felt the authors offered an interesting treatment of optimal
stopping solutions. The relevance to everyday scenarios piqued my interest and
had me thinking of broader implications. I am not wholly convinced that the 
approach is generalisable to most real-world scenarios, which may violate the
problem's assumptions.
