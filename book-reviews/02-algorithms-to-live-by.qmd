## Summary

AtLB is a fantastic read for those naive to the complexity of computer science
and how it can be applied to everyday life. From deciding whether to try a new
restaurant, how best to go about finding your next home to optimising your
socks draw. It turns out, the big brains in modern history have already solved
these problems. The authors take us through the surprising implications that
computer science can have for how we muddle through things, keeping things
light and accessible enough to be categorised under popular science. Though the
authors manage not to undersell sell the impact and after reading this book,
you will never think about sorting in the same way again.

## Chapters

### Introduction

The authors cater for my (and possibly the larger portion of their audience's)
needs by tackling some rather large misconceptions about computer science and
human behaviour. Namely that humans are far too fuzzy-minded, fallible and that
the real world is far too complex to benefit from optimal solutions.
Indeed, the authors do state that some problems are known to be intractible due
to a near infinite number of potential solutions, however those problems
can be defined from the outset. And the rest of life's challenges may often be
reduced to outcomes affected by chance - the search for the right New York
apartment being the particular focus for the intro. Briefly introducing the
optimal stopping problem of whether to put an offer in for an apartment or to
risk losing out on possibly the best apartment on the market by continuing your
search provides an accessible and familiar insight to the direction of the
book.

:::{.callout-note}
"...spend 37% of your apartment hunt (eleven days, if you've given yourself a
month for the search) noncommittally exploring options. Leave the checkbook at
home; you're just calibrating. But after that point, be prepared to immediately
commit - deposit and all - to the very first place that beats whatever you've
already seen." [@AtLB, p.2]
:::

At that point, the authors hit the reader with a little taste of the magic in
this book - that this problem is in many ways solved. That this same type of
solution can be applied to a rane of real world problems from parking your car
to choosing a long-term partner, the concept that there exists a proof that
at 37% of your search time you should immediately flip to committing has an
almost Douglas Adams sort of quality to it.
