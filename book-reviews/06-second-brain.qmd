## Book Summary

Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity book that teaches
how to take and organise effective notes in a digital format. Collating
these records with your own synthesis within a cohesive software ecosystem
in order to improve productivity and support creative work.

> "Those who learn how to leverage technology and master the flow of
information through their lives will be empowered to accomplish anything
they set their minds to."
[@2ndBrain, p.7]


## On the Author

Tiago Forte is a productivity expert known for his work on personal
knowledge management. He studied international business and worked in
various roles, including the Peace Corps in Ukraine, where he taught
productivity techniques. His career in innovation consulting introduced him
to the world of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), leading to the
creation of his training venture,
<a href="https://fortelabs.com/" target="_blank">Forte Labs</a>. This has
since grown into a successful online education company, with Forte
emphasising the integration of personal and professional growth. His work
focuses on helping individuals manage information overload to enhance
creativity and productivity.

## Three Takeaway Ideas

### 1. Consolidation. 

What I liked best about this book was that it didn't feel completely new to
me. It discussed concepts that I had intuited and practised in less formal
ways prior to reading. Therefore, adaptation to a centralised digital
notekeeping  solution would present a minor attitude adjustment, rather
than a complete transformation.

Back in 2015 I had attended a training course on how to get the
most out of Microsoft OneNote, with low expectations and even less interest.
Previously, OneNote had been the perplexing default option for printing
documents - a minor annoyance while I swiftly found the printer I needed.
The training session did a lot to demistify the software and highlighted
some great features which at the time felt quite revolutionary, notably
audio transcription and video embedding within your notes. I proceeded to
use OneNote to record meeting outcomes, transcribe user-testing sessions,
scribble ideas over papers and policy documents and so on. Some of my
colleagues started to notice and asked me about it. I remember saying these
words:

> If I need to find something, I can 'CTRL + F' the software, whereas I
can't do that with a notebook or stack of post-it notes. 

Over time, my digital ecosystem has diversified a bit. Sometimes
because of me and software compatibility with the devices that I use, and
at other times because of preferences of my team. This book made a great
case for favouring interoperable software to achieve a unified notetaking
system. Software that cannot work together is not serving your ability to
retrieve information when it's needed. 

> "Research from Microsoft shows that the average US employee spends 76
hours per year looking for misplaced notes, items, or files. And a report
from the International Data Corporation found that 26 percent of a typical
knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information
spread across a variety of systems."
[@2ndBrain, p.16]

This must be achingly familiar to most modern workers, especially
programmers. Those times when you find yourself Googling for solutions that
you once knew, following purple links that you've already visited. Or trying
to find that salient programming meme in a newly refreshed social media
feed. Surely, everyone has experienced this? Tiago Forte's book suggests
that if we 'get our digital act together', we don't have to rely on our
biological brain for recall. We can farm that job out to a digital
notetaking system which will perform better, recall faster and with greater
accuracy. Instead, we can shift our efforts to synthesis - spotting
connections between notes, adding our interpretations to them and
extracting relevance in the process.
