## Book Summary

Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity book that teaches
how to take and organise effective notes in a digital format. Collating
these records with your own synthesis within a cohesive software ecosystem
in order to improve productivity and support creative work.

> "Those who learn how to leverage technology and master the flow of
information through their lives will be empowered to accomplish anything
they set their minds to."
[@2ndBrain, p.7]


## On the Author

Tiago Forte is a productivity expert known for his work on personal
knowledge management. He studied international business and worked in
various roles, including the Peace Corps in Ukraine, where he taught
productivity techniques. His career in innovation consulting introduced him
to the world of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), leading to the
creation of his training venture,
<a href="https://fortelabs.com/" target="_blank">Forte Labs</a>. This has
since grown into a successful online education company, with Forte
emphasising the integration of personal and professional growth. His work
focuses on helping individuals manage information overload to enhance
creativity and productivity.

## Three Takeaway Ideas

### 1. Consolidation. 

What I liked best about this book was that it didn't feel completely new to
me. It discussed concepts that I had intuited and practised in less formal
ways prior to reading. Therefore, adaptation to a centralised digital
notekeeping  solution would present a minor attitude adjustment, rather
than a complete transformation.

Back in 2015 I had attended a training course on how to get the
most out of Microsoft OneNote, with low expectations and even less interest.
Previously, OneNote had been the perplexing default option for printing
documents - a minor annoyance while I swiftly found the printer I needed.
The training session did a lot to demistify the software and highlighted
some great features which at the time felt quite revolutionary, notably
audio transcription, apply and search notes by tag and video embedding. I
proceeded to use OneNote to record meeting outcomes, transcribe
user-testing sessions, scribble ideas over papers and policy documents and
so on. Some of my colleagues started to notice and asked me about it. I
remember saying these words:

> If I need to find something, I can 'CTRL + F' the software, whereas I
can't do that with a notebook or stack of post-it notes. 

Over time, my digital ecosystem has diversified a bit. Sometimes
because of me and software compatibility with the devices that I use, and
at other times because of the preferences of my team. This book made a
great case for favouring interoperable software to achieve a unified
notetaking system. Software that cannot work together is not serving your
ability to retrieve information when you need it most. 

> "Research from Microsoft shows that the average US employee spends 76
hours per year looking for misplaced notes, items, or files. And a report
from the International Data Corporation found that 26 percent of a typical
knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information
spread across a variety of systems."
[@2ndBrain, p.16]

This must be achingly familiar to most modern workers, especially
programmers. Those times when you find yourself Googling for solutions that
you once knew, following purple links that you've already visited. Or trying
to find that salient programming meme or inspirational quote in a newly
refreshed social media feed. Surely, everyone has experienced this? Tiago
Forte's book suggests that if we 'get our digital act together', we don't
have to rely on our biological brain for recall. We can farm that job out
to a digital notetaking system which will perform better, recall faster and
with greater accuracy. Instead, we can shift our efforts to synthesis -
spotting connections between notes, adding our interpretation to them and
extracting relevance in the process. 

### 2. C.O.D.E.

To anyone who has found themselves mindlessly highlighting reams of a text
with no specific reason in mind, other than in a futile attempt to try to
remember everything (guilty as charged), Forte's C.O.D.E. recipe can offer
clarity:

<img src="https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CODE.001.jpeg" alt="Tiago Forte's recipe for success: Capture, Organise, Distill & Express." width=80% class="center"/>

My interpretation of the recipe is as follows:

<strong style="font-size:24px">C</strong>apture: Your notetaking app should be ready to go at all
times. With the capability to sync across all of your devices and backed up
in the cloud, you should never miss an opportunity to make a record of an
important piece of information, whenever and wherever it presents itself to
you. More on the type of information to capture in a note in
[section 3](#what-to-capture).

<strong style="font-size:24px">O</strong>rganise: Consider where the note should live within your
digital brain. Don't put pressure on yourself to do this straight away, as
it may dissuade you from recording notes in the first place. But use your
default section of a notebook (the area where documents would print to by
default in OneNote for example) as a holding area. You can then triage
these notes later in the day. 

Also, don't agonise over where to locate these notes. Remember that you can
search for them across your entire notebook. In fact, revisiting important
notes and realigning them to new project folders or bringing old notes out
of cold storage can play an important part in the creative process - never
start from scratch again! Every time you initiate a new project, a great
starting point would be to consult existing notes for relevant content.
Most modern notetaking applications also allow you to create internal
links, allowing you to build connections across topics in your digital
notes, or to group notes together under an index page.

<strong style="font-size:24px">D</strong>istill: The author suggests a specific summarising
mechanism to allow at-a-glance knowledge retrieval when revisiting notes.
One crucial element in acquiring knowledge is that you should always
endeavour to do something with the information you wish to learn. Over
time, when the details fade in your mind, it is the impact or relevance of
that information that remains. Forte encourages the reader to develop the
habit of reflecting upon the studied content, leaving helpful summaries
that will aid your future self in retrieving what was important. 

<strong style="font-size:24px">E</strong>xpress: Evaluate. Share the
products of your notetaking efforts and seek feedback from others. Find
opportunities to help those around you in professional communities and
consider how to refine your notes or your note-taking practice. Forte
introduces the concept of "intermediate packets" - over time, projects may
call for common notes or portions of notes to be put to work. In
iteratively refining these packets of information, they can be adapted or
generalised, greatly helping to facilitate future work.

### 3. What to Capture?

The author emphasises the importance of allowing your intuition to guide
you when deciding on what information holds more value within any piece of
text. The more you practise this skill, the better you will become in
extracting the salient points of a text. If that sounds too much like hard
work, the author suggests aligning your priorities to a set of
ongoing projects that will help to guide your attention in capturing,
organising and reflecting upon information.

> "You have to keep a dozen of your favourite problems constantly present
in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every
time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of
your twelve problems to see whether it helps." (Nobel prize-winning
physicist Richard Feynman reflects on his strategy for success)
[@2ndBrain, p.44]

I don't consider the number twelve to be particularly important in all
honesty. But you may have a few longer term targets in a professional
development plan that you would like to progress - why not start with
these? Having sections of your digital brain dedicated to these topics
allows you to orient your efforts and order your thoughts.

Forte also provides direction to those who need more direction in deciding
what information has the greatest utility.

> "Capture Criteria #1: Does It Inspire Me? ...  
> "Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful? ...  
> "Capture Criteria #3: Is It Personal? ...  
> "Capture Criteria #4: Is It Inspiring?"
[@2ndBrain, pp.48-49]

These criteria can be used to help filter the information that you capture,
allowing you to focus on that which is most important. The author offers a
brief explanation for each of the criteria, supported by examples. I am
currently trying these criteria on for size and have included a
highlighting key within my notetaking app to help me remember to use them.

## In Summary

Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the personal
efficacy space. It is full of practical advice and encouragement to get
started or to refine your digital notetaking system. The book contains
plenty of examples that illustrate exactly how to put the ideas into
action, catering for a range of preferred learning styles. Additionally,
the author's system is extremely well-supported and debated online. Check

If this book inspired you to start your own digital notetaking system, you
may find my review of Cal Newport's
[Deep Work](/book-reviews/01-deep-work.qmd) book useful.
