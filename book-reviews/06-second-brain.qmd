## Book Summary

Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity book that teaches
how to take and organise effective notes in a digital format. Collating
these records with your own synthesis within a cohesive software ecosystem
in order to improve productivity and support creative work.

> "Those who learn how to leverage technology and master the flow of
information through their lives will be empowered to accomplish anything
they set their minds to."
[@2ndBrain, p.7]


## On the Author

Tiago Forte is a productivity expert known for his work on personal
knowledge management. He studied international business and worked in
various roles, including the Peace Corps in Ukraine, where he taught
productivity techniques. His career in innovation consulting introduced him
to the world of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), leading to the
creation of his training venture,
<a href="https://fortelabs.com/" target="_blank">Forte Labs</a>. This has
since grown into a successful online education company, with Forte
emphasising the integration of personal and professional growth. His work
focuses on helping individuals manage information overload to enhance
creativity and productivity.

## Three Takeaway Ideas

### 1. Consolidation. 

What I liked best about this book was that it didn't feel completely new to
me. It discussed concepts that I had intuited and practised in less formal
ways prior to reading. Therefore, adaptation to a centralised digital
notekeeping  solution would present a minor attitude adjustment, rather
than a complete transformation.

Back in 2015 I had attended a training course on how to get the
most out of Microsoft OneNote, with low expectations and even less interest.
Previously, OneNote had been the perplexing default option for printing
documents - a minor annoyance while I swiftly found the printer I needed.
The training session did a lot to demistify the software and highlighted
some great features which at the time felt quite revolutionary, notably
audio transcription and video embedding within your notes. I proceeded to
use OneNote to record meeting outcomes, transcribe user-testing sessions,
scribble ideas over papers and policy documents and so on. Some of my
colleagues started to notice and asked me about it. I remember saying these
words:

> If I need to find something, I can 'CTRL + F' the software, whereas I
can't do that with a notebook or stack of post-it notes. 

Over time, my digital ecosystem has diversified a bit. Sometimes
because of me and software compatibility with the devices that I use, and
at other times because of preferences of my team. This book made a great
case for favouring interoperable software to achieve a unified notetaking
system. Software that cannot work together is not serving your ability to
retrieve information when it's needed. 

> "Research from Microsoft shows that the average US employee spends 76
hours per year looking for misplaced notes, items, or files. And a report
from the International Data Corporation found that 26 percent of a typical
knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information
spread across a variety of systems."
[@2ndBrain, p.16]

This must be achingly familiar to most modern workers, especially
programmers. Those times when you find yourself Googling for solutions that
you once knew, following purple links that you've already visited. Or trying
to find that salient programming meme in a newly refreshed social media
feed. Surely, everyone has experienced this? Tiago Forte's book suggests
that if we 'get our digital act together', we don't have to rely on our
biological brain for recall. We can farm that job out to a digital
notetaking system which will perform better, recall faster and with greater
accuracy. Instead, we can shift our efforts to synthesis - spotting
connections between notes, adding our interpretations to them and
extracting relevance in the process. 

### 2. C.O.D.E.

To anyone who has found themselves mindlessly highlighting reams of a text
with no specific reason in mind, other than to try to remember everything,
Forte's C.O.D.E. recipe can offer clarity:

<img src="https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CODE.001.jpeg" alt="Tiago Forte's recipe for success: Capture, Organise, Distill & Express." width=80% class="center"/>

My interpretation of the recipe is as follows:

<strong>C</strong>apture: Your notetaking app should be ready to go at all
times. With the capability to sync across all of your devices and backed up
in the cloud, you should never miss an opportunity to make a record of an
important piece of information, whenever and wherever it presents itself to
you.

<strong>O</strong>rganise: Consider where the note should live within your
digital brain. Don't put pressure on yourself to do this straight away, as
it may dissuade you from recording notes in the first place. But use your
default section of a notebook (the area where documents would print to by
default in OneNote for example) as a holding area. You can then triage
these notes later in the day. 

Also, don't agonise over where to locate these notes. Remember that you can
search for them across your entire notebook. In fact, revisiting important
notes and realigning them to new project folders or bringing old notes out
of cold storage can play an important part in the creative process - never
start from scratch again! Most modern notetaking applications also allow
you to create internal links, allowing you to draw contrasts and
comparisons across topics in your digital notes, or to group notes together
under an index page.

<strong>D</strong>istill: The author suggests a specific summarising
mechanism to allow at-a-glance knowledge retrieval when revisiting notes.
One crucial element in acquiring knowledge is that you should always
endeavour to do something with the information you wish to learn. Over
time, when the details fade in your mind, it is the impact or relevance of
that information that remains. Forte encourages the reader to develop the
habit of reflecting upon the studied content, leaving helpful summaries
that will aid your future self in retrieving what was important. 

<strong>E</strong>xpress: Evaluate. Share the products of your notetaking
efforts and seek feedback from others. Find opportunities to help those
around you in professional communities and consider how to refine your
notes or your note-taking practice.

The book introduces the concept of "intermediate packets" - over time,
pieces of work may call for common notes or portions of notes to be put to
work. In iteratively refining these packets of information, they can be
adapted or generalised - facilitating future work.
