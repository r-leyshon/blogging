## Introduction

At the date of writing this review, Deep Work scores an average of 4.19 / 5.00
across over 141k ratings on
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25744928). Also nominated by
the same website for Best Nonfiction, 2016. Awarded gongs for best book and
best seller in business & leadership by Amazon & the Wall Street Journal. 

This book was recommended to me by a close colleague and I read it on holidays
during some much-needed downtime in the Summer of 2023. I should note that I
reflect on the relevance of the advice in this book to my own personal
circumstances. To that end, it is worth noting that I currently work as a
senior data scientist and that I happen to face many competing priorities in my
day-to-day job.

## Summary

Cal Newport is a celebrated author within the field of personal productivity.
According to his website, Newport is an MIT Grad in Computer Science and a
professor at Georgetown University @CalNewport. Deep Work is structured in 2
parts.

### Part 1: The Idea

Here the author sets out his stall, establishing definitions of fundamental
concepts, such as deep and shallow work and their relative value to the
author's definition of what he refers to as the 'knowledge worker'. The author
sets out noteworthy examples of individuals who (have) had a proven ability to
establish deep thought throughout their illustrious careers. The author then
sets out the case for why deep work is a rewarding endeavor and how its
antithesis of a connected and responsive workday offers little benefit to the
individual, the organisation or society. Yet , many modern organisations have
unwittingly promoted and even entrenched a  shallow work culture among their
employees.



### Part 2: The Rules

In this section, the author offers suggested interventions to make within your
workplace. Exemplifying strategies with personal experience and from those
around him, Newport assists the reader in visualising a professional future
where they can rule their schedule, rather than the reverse.

::: {.callout-note}
"... remain unresponsive to the pinprick onslaught of small obligations that
seem harmless in isolation but aggregate to serious injury to his deep work
habit." [@DeepWork, p.142]
:::

The author
identifies potential sticking points and attempts to treat them, offering
suggested strategies for securing the support of colleagues, stakeholders and
managers in the reader's pursuit of deep work. Moderating his message, Newport
offers words of advice against the pursuit of deep work to the exclusion of 
everything else, yet establishing set constraints within a schedule where
shallow tasks and administrative commitments are not permitted to undo your
daily objectives.

## Analysis and Evaluation

Much of the content in this book resonated with me. Newport takes a contrarian
view of many modern professional practices, such as structuring your day around
group ceremonies like stand ups or scrums, maintaining open channels of
communication via Email and instant messaging applications, and as mentioned
above, social media channels. Many I.T. professionals will find their progress
hampered by a menagerie of ceremonies, administrative tasks and meetings of
ambiguous impact. Understanding how to categorise such meetings and structure
your day around your deep work goals is what Newport hopes to espouse. This has
been a consistent feature of my data-related roles throughout my career.
Striking that balance of engaging with stakeholders versus undertaking the work
can all too often result in a fractured day with little developmental progress. 

That's not to say that Newport promotes a hermetic approach to work. It's clear
to most that the tool, statistic or analysis that is being developed can only
be effective if it is useful. Newport states that these 'shallow' tasks should
be kept in check. They should be minimised and must earn your attention.
Placing a premium on your time and attention is at the core of the book's
message.

::: {.callout-note}
"...for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague,
and perhaps even conflicting restraints, your unconscious mind is well suited
to tackle the issue." [@DeepWork, p.145]
:::
>Above, Newport summarises a high level takeaway from unconscious thought theory
(UTT), which may present a theoretical basis for sleeping on a particularly
challenging problem.

A lot of what Newport writes has rung true in my experience. While not all jobs
have the same requirements, my roles in data have all required a deep focus
disposition. In fact, some of the strategies that the author suggests for
optimising your day, I had independently arrived at. Approaches such as
starting your day before the rest of the office has woken up and keeping Email
responses process-related have both served me well in my career progression so
far. But, there are some suggested strategies that I have not quite been
convinced of. At one point, Newport discusses cognitive strategies for
extending your capacity for deep concentration. The suggested approach is to
remember the order of a shuffled deck of cards. Newport outlines a method for
doing so and cites some studies that are indicative of the positive
relationship between such activities and the mental fortitude required for deep
focus. Personally, I would sacrifice too much time in achieving such a feat,
whereas I would gain more by implementing the task at hand, gradually
incrementing my exposure to deep concentration sessions. Newport does state
that this sort of thinking misses the point entirely, and that investing effort
in such a mental feat pays dividends in the longer term, though I have yet to
be convinced of this claim.

::: {.callout-note}
"...attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in
nature can improve your ability to concentrate. This theory... is based on the
concept of attention fatigue. To concentrate requires what ART calls *directed*
*attention*. This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you'll struggle to
concentrate." [@DeepWork, p.147]
:::
> I found this concept to be very interesting, and a little concerning.
Managing burnout is something that I value. It seems that my pasttimes also
require directed attention, and that perhaps I should pursue recreational
activities that contrast with my professional interests. I have decided to note
within my journal when I notice that I am lacking energy and to resolve to take
a bike ride, swim or just a walk in order to efefctively disconnect and
recharge.

At times throughout the book, I did find myself reflecting that some of the
claims or advice were not as generalisable as the author had perceived. At one
point for example, the Newport suggests diagnosing whether your workplace can
support a culture of deep concentration and finding alternative employment if
the answer was a clear enough 'no'. This did strike me as something that many
colleagues could only dream of, with the reality of bills to pay, children to
feed and job security in an uncertain sector. Advising people to leave rather
than finding alternative strategies to influence managerial culture does seem a
bit thoughtless.

::: {.callout-note}
"Professional E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the
following applies:

* It's ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable
response.
* It's not a question or proposal that interests you.
* Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad
would happen if you didn't." [@DeepWork, p.255]
:::
>I find this advice to be a bit myopic. This is likely great advice for an
accomplished academic with a strong internal locus of control. Junior entrants
to a profession typically need to prove their utility to those with greater
power around them - the decision makers that could be on their next promotion
panel. Ignoring Emails that are a bit ambiguous could result in passing up an
oportunity to help a colleague, forge a new professional relationship or prove
your worth in the workplace. Rather than approaching the needs of others with
derision, I would instead advise time-boxing a response and communicating your
needs clearly to the other party. Something like - 'I'm a bit pushed for time
right now and am not familiar with the context, but if you can point me to a
briefing note I can get back to you on Monday, once I've cleared off my
backlog'.

Another feature of this book which that requires some scepticism is in the
outcomes of studies used to underpin the attitudes and strategies promoted as
good practice. It's likely no news to you that the behavioural sciences has
attracted a fair amount of criticism about the reproducibility of published
findings over the last decade. Coupled with the widespread publication bias
encountered in academic journals @BMJPubBias and confirmation bias abound in
the field of psychology, I would suggest the author reveal some of the research
that they have undertaken in validating the claims of the studies. It is
unlikely that the average reader will have the necessary time to carry out
their own investigation of the findings, and doubt in the ability to evidence
some of the claims within the book is introduced. I do not wish to sound like I
am criticising the author for choosing studies that help to evidence their
claims, as I would have criticised them for not doing so had that been the
case. I would ask that the author publishes their attempts to prove the
hypotheses considered.

> "Don’t trust everything you read in the psychology literature. In fact, two
thirds of it should probably be distrusted." @NatureReproducibility

## Comparisons

There are some obvious comparisons with other productivity self-help books. One
of the most obvious is in Stephen Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People @Covey. Both books make an effort to discuss the management of competing
priorities and how to go about organising your working day around prioritised,
impactful goals. Covey's book dedicates more energy towards effectively
triaging tasks and charting progress made against longer-term priorities than
what is explored within Deep Work. In fact, this may be another presumption
made by Newport - that the direction of progress is obvious to the reader and
it is simply a matter of finding the undisturbed time to do the work. As many
of us will encounter uncertainty and a fair amount of strategic thrashing in
our working lives, this could prove to be a limiting assumption.

Below is an example of what is commonly referred to as a "Covey Quadrant", a
rubric for efficiently categorising tasks along dimensions of urgency and
importance.

## Recommendation

There is a lot of wisdom to be gleaned from this book. Sure, some of it may be
anecdotal and won't be true in all cases. But there is an undeniable pattern in
the examples provided, that sustained effort yields desirable outcomes. This is
something that I have always found to be true and connects with my wider
values. It is this message and the useful reminders and strategies that would
form the basis of my recommendation for this book. This book is an opportunity
to gain insight into how the elite of the achievers in society get things done.
You may be able to make some of this work for you but don't expect it to be
easy, or perhaps even achievable in your current situation.

To put it bluntly, if you have ever struggled to quiet the noise at work and
get things done, then this book is for you. (It's not lost on me that that may
qualify pretty much everyone who has ever worked in an office).
