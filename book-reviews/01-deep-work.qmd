## Summary

Cal Newport is a celebrated author within the field of personal productivity.
According to his website, Cal is an MIT Grad in Computer Science and a
professor at Georgetown University @CalNewport. Deep Work is structured in 2
parts.

### Part 1: The Idea.

Here the author sets out his stall, establishing definitions of fundamental
concepts, such as deep and shallow work and their relative value to the author's
definition of what he refers to as the 'knowledge worker'. The author sets out
noteworthy examples of individuals who (have) had a proven ability to
establish deep thought throughout their illustrious careers. The author then
sets out the case for why deep work is a rewarding endeavor and how its
antithesis of a highly connected and responsive workday offers little benefit
to the individual, the organisation or society. Yet counterintuitively, many
modern organisations have perhaps unwittingly promoted and even entrenched a 
shallow work culture among their employees.

### Part 2: The Rules.

In this section, the author offers suggested interventions to make within your
workplace. Exemplifying strategies with personal experience and from those
around him, Cal assists the reader in visualising a professional future where
they can rule their schedule, rather than the reverse. The author identifies
potential sticking points and attempts to proactively treat them, offering
suggested strategies for securing the support of colleagues, stakeholders and
managers in the reader's pursuit of deep work. Moderating his message, Cal
offers words of advice against the pursuit of deep work to the exclusion of 
everything else, yet establishing set constraints within a schedule where
shallow tasks and administrative commitments are not permitted to undo your
daily objectives.
