## Introduction

As of today's date, Amusing Ourselves to Death (AOtD) scores an average of
4.15 / 5.00 over 29.5k ratings on
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death).


## Summary

AOtD is a challenging read for a short book. It is heaped in cultural criticism
and a pessimistic assessment of technological development that I would not
recommend readilty internalising without thoughtful evaluation. However, much
of the critique is well-reasoned and although written in the 1980s, is possibly
of greater relevance today than when first penned.


### On the Authors


## An Overview of the Book

Postman's critique is that the widespread adoption of television has subversively
influenced culture, human behaviour and intellect in ways that could not be
foreseen. Unaware of the broad repercussions of immersing ourselves in TV pop
culture, the standards for entertainment in this medium of communication have
permeated through society, from the boardroom to the classroom. 

Postman warns that a culture; seemingly unaware of how trivial and distracted it
has become; is at risk of losing its moral compass, leading to a state of shallow
and low-value communication. The main premise of his warning is that rather than
an Orwellian dystopian future where society is controlled by a despotic
surveillance state, the dystopia that Postman predicts would be better
characterised by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. A future where a simpleton
proletariat has been renderred ineffectual by the pursuit of hedonism at the
cost of all else.

The book is organised into 2 parts and 11 chapters.

Part 1 achieves the scale of the apparent decline in literacy, logic and debate
brought about by movement away from a largely print-based culture to one that
celebrates moving pictures.

Part 2 argues that aspects of TV as a medium impose limitations on the length
of exposition and the complexity of discourse that has widely influenced our
lives. Postman exemplifies how this simplification of our public discourse has
declined, with considerations from many important domains of modern culture.
