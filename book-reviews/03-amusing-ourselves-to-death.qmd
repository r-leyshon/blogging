## Summary

AOtD is a challenging read for a short book. It is heaped in cultural criticism
and a pessimistic assessment of technological development that I would not
recommend readilty internalising without thoughtful evaluation. However, much
of the critique is well-reasoned and although written in the 1980s, is possibly
of greater relevance today than when first penned.

### On the Author

Neil Postman was a professor of communication at New York University. Well-known
for his body of work in examining the study of knowledge-acquisition and
pedagogy through the lens of societal decline. Postman endeavoured to influence
public education curricula in the United States during his term as Chairman of
the University's Department for Culture and Communication.

## An Overview of the Book

Postman's critique is that the widespread adoption of television has
subversively influenced culture, human behaviour and intellect in ways that
could not be foreseen. Unaware of the broad repercussions of immersing
ourselves in TV pop culture, the standards for entertainment in this medium of
communication have permeated through society, from the boardroom to the
classroom. 

Postman warns that a culture; seemingly unaware of how trivial and distracted it
has become; is at risk of losing its moral compass, leading to a state of shallow
and low-value communication. The main premise of his warning is that rather than
an Orwellian dystopian future where society is controlled by a despotic
surveillance state, the dystopia that Postman predicts would be better
characterised by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. A future where a simpleton
proletariat has been renderred ineffectual by the pursuit of hedonism at the
cost of all else.

The book is organised into 2 parts and 11 chapters.

Part 1 achieves the scale of the apparent decline in literacy, logic and debate
brought about by movement away from a largely print-based culture to one that
celebrates moving pictures.

Part 2 argues that aspects of TV as a medium impose limitations on the length
of exposition and the complexity of discourse that has widely influenced our
lives. Postman exemplifies how this simplification of our public discourse has
declined, with considerations from many important domains of modern culture.

### Part 1

The book begins with a treatment of Huxley's warning in a brave new world. A
future in which civilisation is threatened by an over-supply of information and
a reduction of the peoples' ability to identify that which has meaning. Postman
suggests that Western culture had been *en guarde* for signs of Orwellian
oppression but has not adopted a defence against the possibility that our own
ignorance may oppress ourselves.

#### 1. The Medium Is the Metaphor

Postman argues that the technological revolution brought about by mass adoption
of television has unwittingly changed the fabric of our society. Using the
analogy of the clock, Postman indicates that the mechanism is not merely a
device used for measuring time, but that it "dissociates time from human events
and thus nourishes the belief in an independent world of mathematically
measurable sequences." [@AOtD, p.12]. 

This analogy does not
help someone who is subject to the belief of quantifiable sequence in understanding
his point. The thought of a world without clocks is an unimaginable dystopia.
The positives that the clock have wrought greatly outweigh any possible drawbacks
that I can conceive of. This may be the point entirely - just as the fish is
likely unaware that it lives within water, the ability of the human mind to
conceive of how it has been influenced by a technology that has been fully integrated
through society may be similarly limited.

Postman goes on to state that the clock has removed the concept of god from the
meaning of time, so I am lost as to how to meaningfully rationalise his
analogy. My takeaway is that a consequence of reducing the concept of
time to the machinations of gears removes any sense of reverance or magical
thought, although some would argue that the internals of an analogue clock
are a thing of beauty and the trade of the watchmaker an art. Nonetheless
the reduction of time to a gadget now worn on the wrist may have effects beyond
a greater ability to manage time, possibly influencing our perception of our place in the
universe. The comparison with television's replacement of print seems to mean
that there are unintended consequences owing to the adoption of a novel
technology that are perhaps poorly understood.

#### 2. Media as Epistemology

In this chapter, Postman considers the nature of truth, the acquirement of
knowledge and how this has changed with the cultural trend toward visual media.
The author posits the concept that all media are not equal in their ability to
convey meaning and truth.

An interesting juxtaposition is explored - that in certain circumstances, the
medium of spoken word is thought to be of higher merit than the written, such
as in most modern courtrooms where verbal rather than written testimony is
required. However, Postman is able to draw on his experience in academia to
illustrate that the reverse is true in the assessment of a final year thesis,
where a candidate had attempted to cite ephemereal evidence; a conversation
or interview with an academic. In this example the result had been a witty
retort from the review panel that:

"...we are sure you would prefer that this
commission produce a written statement that you have passed your examination
(should you do so) than for us merely to tell you that you have, and leave it
at that. Our written statement would represent the "truth". Our oral agreement
would be only a rumour." [@AOtD, p.24].

Who could argue with that? Yet despite the passive aggression occasioned in academic
assessment, the contrast between written and spoken discourse truth value may
glaze over the context and purposes. The courtroom favours verbal testimony as
an unadulterated recount of the past and motive, yet quickly commits this
testimony to the written word via courtroom stenographers. An unfiltered
account for a thesis would only serve as a draft and would require significant
editing in order to test that the structure and content of the paper is robust.

Postman goes on to examine truth as a cultural prejudice for certain media. From
tribal counsel's use of parable through Aristotle's deductive reasoning about
the physical world. Postman rounds to the modern world's adherance to the
quantifiable.

"Many of our psychologists, sociologists, economists... will have numbers to tell
them the truth or they will have nothing. Can you imagine, for example, a modern
economist articulating truths about our standard of living by reciting a poem?"
[@AOtD, p.26]

While an entertaining diversion, I wonder if numbers can be considered a medium.
It occurs to me that numbers are a language that can be expressed in a variety
of media. An interesting perspective to be explored would have been the danger
of an over-reliance on statistics as truth. The fact that statistics can be
selectively deployed to make opposing arguments is of course, not a new one.

:::{.callout-note}
"Lies, damned lies, and statistics." *attribution debated*.
:::

The use of numbers to oversimplify, diminish context and misdirect can also be
a misuse of data visualisation.

"...it makes the viewer believe that they can see everything, all at once, from
an imaginary and impossible standpoint. But itâ€™s also a trick because what
appears to be everything, and what appears to be neutral, is always ... a
partial perspective." [@DataFeminism, chapter 3]. 

Perhaps all of us are guilty of accepting a viewpoint based on the convincing
support of charts or numbers, without undertaking the necessary due diligence
of reproducing the analysis and seriously examining the null hypothesis.

#### 3. Typographic America

The author uses this chapter to familiarise the reader with an abridged history
of literacy from 17<sup>th</sup> century England and the United States to the modern day. Thanks
primarily to the efforts of the churches, literacy among the general populace
was understood to have been significantly higher than in the modern day populace. But with a decline in the relevance
of the printed word, literacy rates have steadily declined over the previous century.

17<sup>th</sup>
century people were conditioned to spend long hours of leisure time focussed
upon reading a single book. This mental fortitude affected their ability and predeliction
for other feats of mental endurance. Debating halls were common across the country and
accounts of debates extending long into the evenings were said to be common. The contrast
between these discussions and the modern approach to televised debates must be striking.
It is here that I have little to argue with Postman's position. It is undoubtedly true
that television is a poor medium for long format discourse. In general, if a
topic cannot be reduced to chunks of ten second soundbites, it generally makes
for poor television.

While television is an enjoyable entertainment device, the demands of its
format aim to keep the viewer perpetually stimulated and do not imbue its
audience with mental fortitude. Postman's position is that this lack of mental
preparation against boredom leaves us struggling to achieve focus in many other
contexts. These known limitations of television have given rise to the podcast
format in recent years, where a type of long format debate has returned to public
fora. Although whether this format will remain consistent in its aversion of
advertisment as it grows remains to be seen. 

#### 4. The Typographic Mind

In this chapter the author explores how a sustained media shift away from the
printed word may have influenced our assessment of culture's interpretation of
truth. The author compares the image-obsessed standards of the televised news
shows to a form of infantilism. Where assessment of truth is based upon the
appearance of the newscaster rather than the content of the televised message.
An industry-wide *ad hominem* has permeated through even those shows that are
intended to be sober and informative. Postman suggests that the form of truth
and intelligence valued by 'the typographic' mind (pre-television) would have
been markedly different. 


An interesting point is made about an unspoken contract between television and
those appearing on it. The author argues that the dominant media in our society
governs the behaviours of those wishing to exploit that as a tool. How
politicians, scholars and religious figures are reduced to a fickle celebrity
by the demands of a television presence - curate your image, reduce your
campaign to sound bites, prioritise speed over reason. In considering the first
15 presidents of the United States, Postman states,

"Public figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by
their looks or even their oratory... To think about those men was to think
about what they had written, to judge them by their public positions, their
arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word." [@AOtD, p.70].

Recalling any of the notable icons of the twentieth century would entail
recalling their image rather than the content of their words or actions.
Political campaigns have been won and lost at the hands of advertisment
budgets, party political broadcasts and impactful slogans. It appears that we
are in the midst of fast food politics, a genereation of the slogan-oriented
and averse to analysis of manifesto.

#### 5. The Peek-a-Boo World

In The Peek-a-Boo World, the author establishes his concept of the "information
-action ratio", a novel concept considering the relevance of the communication
 a person is subject to.

 "...how often does it occur that information provided you on morning radio or
 television, or in the morning newspaper, causes you to alter your plans for
 the day, or to take some action you would not otherwise have taken, or
 provides insight into some problem you are required to solve?" [@AOtD, p.78]

 The author goes on to qualify such exceptions as the weather and stock
 movements. It is an interesting concept and I have pondered the point, finding
 exceptions here and there, such as programmes that help people to manage their
 finances, special interest shows such as gardening series, so on. I can
 estimate how important shows such as *Songs of Praise* must be for those who
 are unable to participate in the communal observation of their religion in
 person. Undeniably, these shows would be exceptions that prove the rule - that
 the purpose of the television is primarily to entertain, even when it purports
 to inform.

 Postman's criticism of what has become "The News of the Day", which he states
 started with the invention of the telegraph and has been further transformed
 by a partnership between television and modern newspapers into the 'human
 interest' genre, is that the information is low in information-action ratio.
 On the telegraph, "news from nowhere, addressed to no one in particular, began
 to criss-cross the nation" [@AOtD, p.78].

 This commodification of contextless information was bolstered by photography.
 Once papers adopted the photograph, "For countless Americans, seeing not
 reading, became the basis for believing" [@AOtD, p.86]. A prescient point as
 we enter the age of the deep fake.
 
 The author's point is that our culture is bombarded with low-relevance
 information. I identify with this argument in that I have found the
 combination of a negative news loop and continual outrage on social media to
 have caused a shift in my behaviour away from those media. Yet I also note
 that at the time of writing this blog, our country has experienced its
 largest sustained demonstration in hostory. The images and stories on the
 current war between Israel and Hamas have caused people across the country to
 consider their own position on the matter, arousing strong emotions that have
 led to these mass demonstrations. Similarly during the Covid-19 lockdowns, the
 greater part of the nation coalesced around the television to gain their news
 from the Covid press briefings. While the vast majority of television's
 content may be almost irrelevant to those subject to it, its ability to
 influence thoughts and feelings on a mass scale may be magnified during crises.

 I will complete my review of Part 1 on the warning that has troubled me the
 most. That TV-culture has become the dominant culture in a way that we can no
 longer separate the two. 

 "Twenty years ago, the question, does television shape culture or merely
 reflect it? held considerable interest for many scholars and social critics.
 The question has largely disappeared as television has gradually *become* our
 culture. This means, among other things, that we rarely talk about television..."

As fish are unaware of the water around them, we are immersed in TV culture and
may be largely unaware of how this has mediated our thoughts. One could argue
that the relevance of television is in decline and that newer forms of media
are to dominate the future. I would argue that the addictive properties of the
mobile phone tend to be those that ape features of television, but one that
can follow you out of your living room, accompany you on your dog walk and keep
you enthralled on your drive to work. It seems that the human predeliction for
entertainment is all too capable of subjugating notions of personal safety.
