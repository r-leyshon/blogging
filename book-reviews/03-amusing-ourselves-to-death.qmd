## Summary

AOtD is a challenging read for a short book. It is heaped in cultural criticism
and a pessimistic assessment of technological development that I would not
recommend readilty internalising without thoughtful evaluation. However, much
of the critique is well-reasoned and although written in the 1980s, is possibly
of greater relevance today than when first penned.

### On the Author

Neil Postman was a professor of communication at New York University. Well-known
for his body of work in examining the study of knowledge-acquisition and
pedagogy through the lens of societal decline. Postman endeavoured to influence
public education curricula in the United States during his term as Chairman of
the University's Department for Culture and Communication.

## An Overview of the Book

Postman's critique is that the widespread adoption of television has
subversively influenced culture, human behaviour and intellect in ways that
could not be foreseen. Unaware of the broad repercussions of immersing
ourselves in TV pop culture, the standards for entertainment in this medium of
communication have permeated through society, from the boardroom to the
classroom. 

Postman warns that a culture; seemingly unaware of how trivial and distracted it
has become; is at risk of losing its moral compass, leading to a state of shallow
and low-value communication. The main premise of his warning is that rather than
an Orwellian dystopian future where society is controlled by a despotic
surveillance state, the dystopia that Postman predicts would be better
characterised by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. A future where a simpleton
proletariat has been renderred ineffectual by the pursuit of hedonism at the
cost of all else.

The book is organised into 2 parts and 11 chapters.

Part 1 achieves the scale of the apparent decline in literacy, logic and debate
brought about by movement away from a largely print-based culture to one that
celebrates moving pictures.

Part 2 argues that aspects of TV as a medium impose limitations on the length
of exposition and the complexity of discourse that has widely influenced our
lives. Postman exemplifies how this simplification of our public discourse has
declined, with considerations from many important domains of modern culture.

### Part 1

The book begins with a treatment of Huxley's warning in a brave new world. A
future in which civilisation is threatened by an over-supply of information and
a reduction of the peoples' ability to identify that which has meaning. Postman
suggests that Western culture had been *en guarde* for signs of Orwellian
oppression but has not adopted a defence against the possibility that our own
ignorance may oppress ourselves.

#### 1. The Medium Is the Metaphor

Postman argues that the technological revolution brought about by mass adoption
of television has unwittingly changed the fabric of our society. Using the
analogy of the clock, Postman indicates that the mechanism is not merely a
device used for measuring time, but that it "dissociates time from human events
and thus nourishes the belief in an independent world of mathematically
measurable sequences." [@AOtD, p.12]. 

This analogy does not
help someone who is subject to the belief of quantifiable sequence in understanding
his point. The thought of a world without clocks is an unimaginable dystopia.
The positives that the clock have wrought greatly outweigh any possible drawbacks
that I can conceive of. This may be the point entirely - just as the fish is
likely unaware that it lives within water, the ability of the human mind to
conceive of how it has been manipulated when a technology has been fully integrated
through society may be similarly limited.

Postman goes on to state that the clock has removed the concept of god from the
meaning of time, so I am lost as to how to meaningfully rationalise his
argument at times. I come away with the argument that a consequence of reducing the concept of
time to the machinations of gears removes any sense of reverance or magical
thought, although some would argue that the internals of an analogue clock
are a thing of beauty and the trade of the watchmaker an art. Nonetheless
the reduction of time to a gadget now worn on the risk may have effects beyond
a greater ability to manage time, possibly influencing our perception of our place in the
universe. The comparison with television's replacement of print seems to mean
that there are unintended consequences owing to the adoption of a novel
technology that are perhaps poorly understood.
