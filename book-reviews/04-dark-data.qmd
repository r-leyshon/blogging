## Book Summary

"Dark Data: Why What You Don't Know Matters" by David J. Hand delves into the
crucial concept of dark data â€” information that is unseen, uncollected, or
unanalysed but significantly impacts decision-making and understanding. Hand
categorises dark data into 15 types, including self-selection bias and
time-dependent missing data, illustrating the dangers of ignoring such data
through historical and contemporary examples like FDR's reelection polls and
the Challenger shuttle disaster. The book highlights how unrecognized dark data
can lead to skewed understandings, incorrect conclusions, and flawed actions.

> "The first step must always be to be aware there might be dark data. Indeed,
your default assumption should be that the data are incomplete or inaccurate.
*That is the most important message of this book: be suspicious about the data*
- at least until it is proved they are adequate and accurate."
[@darkdata, p.293]

Hand emphasizes the importance of recognising and mitigating dark data,
teaching readers to be vigilant about the issues posed by unknown information.
He also explores how dark data can be strategically utilised. The book
addresses various statistical methods and concepts, underscoring that even in
the age of big data, the data available is never complete. Through practical
guidance, Hand aims to help readers make better decisions in a world where
missing data is inevitable, stressing the significance of understanding what is
not known.

## On the Author

David J. Hand is a distinguished British statistician born in Peterborough,
England. He received his BA from the University of Oxford and his PhD from the
University of Southampton. Hand's academic career includes significant roles
such as serving as a professor of statistics at the Open University from 1988
to 1999 and later becoming an Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at Imperial
College London, where he also worked as a Senior Research Investigator. His
research interests are broad and include multivariate statistics,
classification methods, pattern recognition, computational statistics, and the
foundations of statistics, with a keen focus on data mining, data science, and
big data.

## 3 Takeaways

### On Human Bias

> "...At least until the scientific revolution... advances in understanding
were retarded by a (typically subconscious) reluctance to collect data which
might discprove a theory... advances were held back by an unwillingness to make
dark data visible...

My favourite historical example of someone who spotted this problem is given by
the seventeenth-century philosopher, Francis Bacon, who wrote: "Human
understanding when it has once adpopted an opinion... draws all things else to
support and agree with it. And though there be a great number and weight of
instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects and
despises, or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects."
" [@darkdata, pp. 167-168]

Link to Bill Bryson, continental drift.

### Publication Bias

> "Yet another cause of mistaken results is the pernicious practice called
"HARKing", or *H*ypothesizing *A*fter the *R*esult is known...

HARKing can be alleviated by requiring researchers to state their hypotheses
before they collect any data. Some scientific journals are considering moving
in this direction, guaranteeing publication of a paper regardless of how the 
results come out...
" [@darkdata, pp.198-199]

### Missingness

Hand adapts the American Statistician Donald Rubin's description of the causes
of missing data into the following:

* Unseen Data Dependent (UDD): The cause of the missingness is related to the
value of the datum. No reason for this missingness can be discerned from the
extant data.
* Seen Data Dependent (SDD): A clue to the reason for the missing datum is
available within the extant data. 
* Not Data Dependent (NDD): The reason for the missingess is unrelated to the
extant data.

Hand's explanation of Complete Case Analysis is an excellent warning to all
those new to data science. The very common practice of dropping or imputing
missing values from the data can be a very risky business. What if there were
an underlying pattern in the missingness? Hand employs a perfectly clear,
simple tabular example that have no complete cases, meaning that dropping
missing observations would result in no records. 

> "...if the dark data were not NDD, then even a small reduction in sample size
could mean we were left with a distorted data set." [@darkdata, p.237]
