## Book Summary

"Dark Data: Why What You Don't Know Matters" by David J. Hand delves into the
crucial concept of dark data â€” information that is unseen, uncollected, or
unanalysed but significantly impacts decision-making and understanding. Hand
categorises dark data into 15 types, including self-selection bias and
time-dependent missing data, illustrating the dangers of ignoring such data
through historical and contemporary examples like FDR's reelection polls and
the Challenger shuttle disaster. The book highlights how unrecognized dark data
can lead to skewed understandings, incorrect conclusions, and flawed actions.

> "The first step must always be to be aware there might be dark data. Indeed,
your default assumption should be that the data are incomplete or inaccurate.
*That is the most important message of this book: be suspicious about the data*
- at least until it is proved they are adequate and accurate."
[@darkdata, p.293]

Hand emphasizes the importance of recognising and mitigating dark data,
teaching readers to be vigilant about the issues posed by unknown information.
He also explores how dark data can be strategically utilised. The book
addresses various statistical methods and concepts, underscoring that even in
the age of big data, the data available is never complete. Through practical
guidance, Hand aims to help readers make better decisions in a world where
missing data is inevitable, stressing the significance of understanding what is
not known.
