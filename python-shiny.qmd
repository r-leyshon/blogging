[Python Shiny](https://pypi.org/project/shiny/) celebrates its first year
anniversary on PyPi in July 2023. In case that needs further qualification, this
is the Python-native implementation of the beloved RShiny dashboarding package
that has been available in the R programming framework for over a decade now. 
Python Shiny has benefited from the experience that the developers at
[Posit](https://posit.co/) have gained in building its more mature,
R-flavoured sibling.

  

Python Shiny has experienced what I would describe as an accelerated evolution
and has the potential to become a frontrunner in Pythonic, production-grade
applications. Mainly because it adheres to an evaluation strategy which is a bit
un-pythonic. Shiny introduces dashboarding with lazy evaluation, meaning that
elements of your code will only be evaluated when there is a need to do so. This
is not always a great idea, particularly for procedural or object-oriented
programming. But it does make event-drive applications more efficient and
scalable. More on [Posit's take on the USP of Python Shiny here](https://posit.co/blog/why-shiny-for-python/).
