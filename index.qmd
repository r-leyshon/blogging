## Intro

A site to store blogs about programming concepts, software development and data
science. Generally things that future me will be thankful that I've recorded
these things somewhere. 


## Site Overview

* [Blogs](blogs/index.qmd) : Explanations, tutorials, how-to guides. All blogs
are regarding technical subjects and are categorised according to the excellent
[diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

* [Music Reviews](music-reviews/index.qmd) : I listen to strictly non-verbal
music when programming. This was a habit that I developed while working within
a busy office environment. Instrumental music of several genres has helped me
efficiently establish a state of mental flow required for deep concentration.
I'll include reviews of some of my favourite albums here, categorised by genre.

* [Book Reviews](book-reviews/index.qmd) : Much of my casual reading is
non-fiction tangential to programming. I'll review material here that I have
found to be supportive of my work in various aspects, categorised by genre.
