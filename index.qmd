## Intro

A site to store blogs about programming concepts, software development and data
science. Generally things that future me will be thankful that I've recorded
these things somewhere.


## Site Overview

* [Byte-Wise Musings](blogs/index.qmd) : Technical blogs, Explanations,
tutorials, how-to guides. All articles are categorised according to the
excellent [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

* [Productivity Pulse](music-reviews/index.qmd) : Music reviews. I listen to
strictly non-verbal music when programming. This was a habit that I developed
while working within a busy office environment. Instrumental music of several
genres has helped me efficiently establish a state of mental flow required for
deep concentration. I'll include reviews of some of my favourite albums here,
categorised by genre.

* [Bookmarked Insights](book-reviews/index.qmd) : Book reviews. Much of my
casual reading is non-fiction tangential to programming. I'll review material
here that I have found to be supportive of my work in various aspects,
categorised by genre.
