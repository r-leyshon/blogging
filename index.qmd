## Intro

A site to store blogs about programming concepts, software development and
data science. Generally things that future me will be thankful that I've
recorded.

## Site Overview

* [Technical Blogs](blogs/index.qmd) : Technical blogs, Explanations,
tutorials, how-to guides. All articles are categorised according to the
excellent [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

* [Music Reviews](music-reviews/index.qmd) : Mostly album reviews. I listen
to instrumental music when programming. This was a habit that I developed
while working within a busy office environment. This has helped me
efficiently establish a state of mental flow required for deep
concentration. I'll include reviews of some of my favourite albums here.

* [Book Reviews](book-reviews/index.qmd) : Much of my casual reading is
non-fiction and tangential to programming. I'll review material here that I
have found to be supportive of my work in various aspects.
