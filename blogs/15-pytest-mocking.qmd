## Introduction

`pytest` is a testing package for the python framework. It is broadly used to
quality assure code logic. This article discusses the dark art of mocking, why
you should do it and the nuts and bolts of implementing mocked tests. This blog
is the fourth in a series of blogs called
[pytest in plain English](/blogs/index.qmd#category=pytest-in-plain-english),
favouring accessible language and simple examples to explain the more intricate
features of the `pytest` package.

For a wealth of documentation, guides and how-tos, please consult the
<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/" target="_blank">`pytest` documentation</a>.

### What does Mocking Mean?

Code often has external dependencies:

* Web APIs (as in this article)
* Websites (if scraping / crawling)
* External code (importing packages)
* Data feeds and databases
* Environment variables

As developers cannot control the behaviour of those dependencies, they would
not write tests dependent upon them. In order to test their source code that
depends on these services, developers need to replace the properties of these
services when the test suite runs. Injecting replacement values into the code
at runtime is generally referred to as mocking. Mocking these values means that
developers can feed dependable results to their code and make reliable
assertions about the code's behaviour, without changes in the 'outside world'
affecting outcomes in the system under test.

Developers who write unit tests may also mock their own code. The "unit" in the
term "unit test" implies complete isolation from external dependencies. Mocking
is an indispensible tool in achieving that isolation within a test suite. It
ensures that code can be efficiently verified in any order, without
dependencies on other elements in your codebase. However, mocking also adds to
code complexity, increasing cognitive load and generally making things harder
to debug.

### A Note on the Purpose (Click to expand)

This article intends to discuss clearly. It doesn't aim to be clever or
impressive. Its aim is to extend understanding without overwhelming the reader.
The code may not always be optimal, favouring a simplistic approach wherever
possible.

:::

### Intended Audience

Programmers with a working knowledge of python, HTTP requests and some
familiarity with `pytest` and packaging. The type of programmer who has
wondered about how to follow best practice in testing python code.

### What You'll Need:

- [ ] Preferred python environment manager (eg `conda`)
- [ ] `pip install pytest==8.1.1 requests mockito`
- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub account
- [ ] Command line access

### Preparation

This blog is accompanied by code in
[this repository](https://github.com/r-leyshon/pytest-fiddly-examples). The
main branch provides a template with the minimum structure and requirements
expected to run a `pytest` suite. The repo branches contain the code used in
the examples of the following sections.

Feel free to fork or clone the repo and checkout to the example branches as
needed.

The example code that accompanies this article is available in the
[mocking branch](https://github.com/r-leyshon/pytest-fiddly-examples/tree/mocking)
of the repo.

## Overview

Mocking is one of the trickier elements of testing. It's a bit niche and is
often perceived to be too hacky to be worth the effort. The options for mocking
in python are numerous and this adds to the complexity of many example
implementations you will find online. 

There is also a compromise in simplicity versus flexibility. Some of the
options available are quite involved and can be adapted to the nichest of
cases, but may not be the best option for those new to mocking. With this in
mind, I present 3 alternative methods for mocking python source code. So if
you'll forgive me, this is the first of the
[`pytest` in plain English](/blogs/index.qmd#category=pytest-in-plain-english)
series where I introduce alternative testing practices from beyond the `pytest`
package.

1. [**monkeypatch**][monkeypatch]: The `pytest` fixture designed for mocking. The
origin of the fixture's name is debated but potentially arose from the term
'guerrilla patch' which may have been misinterpreted as 'gorilla patch'. This
is the concept of modifying source code at runtime, which probably sounds a bit
like 'monkeying with the code'.
2. [**MagicMock**][magicmock]: This is the mocking object provided by python3's
builtin `unittest` package.
3. [**mockito**][mockito]: This package is based upon the popular Java framework
of the same name. Despite having a user-friendly syntax, `mockito` is robust
and secure.

### A note on the language

Mocking has a bunch of synonyms & related language which can be a bit
off-putting. All of the below terms are associated with mocking. Some may be
preferred to the communities of specific programming frameworks over others.

| Term          | Brief Meaning | Frameworks/Libraries |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Mocking       | Creating objects that simulate the behaviour of real objects for testing | Mockito (Java), unittest.mock (Python), Jest (JavaScript), Moq (.NET)            |
| Spying        | Observing and recording method calls on real objects                    | Mockito (Java), Sinon (JavaScript), unittest.mock (Python), RSpec (Ruby) |
| Stubbing      | Replacing methods with predefined behaviours or return values            | Sinon (JavaScript), RSpec (Ruby), PHPUnit (PHP), unittest.mock (Python)      |
| Patching      | Temporarily modifying or replacing parts of code for testing            | unittest.mock (Python), pytest-mock (Python), PowerMock (Java)             |
| Faking        | Creating simplified implementations of complex dependencies             | Faker (multiple languages), Factory Boy (Python), FactoryGirl (Ruby)           |
| Dummy Objects | Placeholder objects passed around but never actually used               | Can be created in any testing framework                                          |

## Mocking in Python

This section will walk through some code that uses HTTP requests to an external
service and how we can go about testing the code's behaviour without relying on
that service being available. Feel free to clone the repository and check out
to the
[example code](https://github.com/r-leyshon/pytest-fiddly-examples/tree/mocking)
branch to run the examples.

The purpose of the code is to retrieve jokes from <https://icanhazdadjoke.com/>
like so:

```{python}
#| echo: false

import requests


def _query_endpoint(endp:str, usr_agent:str, f:str,) -> requests.models.Response:
    """Utility for formatting query string & requesting endpoint."""
    HEADERS = {
        "User-Agent": usr_agent,
        "Accept": f,
        }
    resp = requests.get(endp, headers=HEADERS)
    return resp


def _handle_response(r: requests.models.Response) -> str:
    """Utility for handling reponse object & returning text content."""
    if r.ok:
        c_type = r.headers["Content-Type"]
        if c_type == "application/json":
            content = r.json()
            content = content["joke"]
        elif c_type == "text/plain":
            content = r.text
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(
                "This client accepts 'application/json' or 'text/plain' format"
                )
    else:
        raise requests.HTTPError(
            f"{r.status_code}: {r.reason}"
        )
    return content


def get_joke(
    endp:str = "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/",
    usr_agent:str = "datasavvycorner.com (https://github.com/r-leyshon/pytest-fiddly-examples)", 
    f:str = "text/plain",
) -> str:
    """Request a joke from icanhazdadjoke.com."""
    r = _query_endpoint(endp=endp, usr_agent=usr_agent, f=f)
    return _handle_response(r)
```

```{python}
for _ in range(3):
    print(get_joke(f="application/json"))

```

::: {.callout-caution}

The jokes are provided by <https://icanhazdadjoke.com/> and are not curated by
me. In my testing of the service I have found the jokes to be harmless fun, but
I cannot guarantee that. If an offensive joke is returned, this is
unintentional but
[let me know about it](https://github.com/r-leyshon/blogging/issues) and I will
generate new jokes.

:::

### Define the Source Code

The function `get_joke()` uses 2 internals:

1. `_query_endpoint()` Used to construct the HTTP request with required headers
and user agent.
2. `_handle_response()` Used to catch HTTP errors, or to pull the text out of
the various response formats.

```{python filename="example_pkg.only_joking.py"}
"""Retrieve dad jokes available."""
import requests


def _query_endpoint(
    endp:str, usr_agent:str, f:str,
    ) -> requests.models.Response:
    """Utility for formatting query string & requesting endpoint."""
    HEADERS = {
        "User-Agent": usr_agent,
        "Accept": f,
        }
    resp = requests.get(endp, headers=HEADERS)
    return resp

```

Keeping separate, the part of the codebase that you wish to target for mocking
is often the simplest way to go about things. The target for our mocking will
be the command that integrates with the external service, so `requests.get()`
here. 

The use of `requests.get()` in the code above depends on a few things:

1. An endpoint string.
2. A dictionary with string values for the keys "User-Agent" and "Accept".

We'll need to consider those dependencies when mocking. Once we return a
response from the external service, we need a utility to handle the various
statuses of that response:

```{python filename="example_pkg.only_joking.py"}
"""Retrieve dad jokes available."""
import requests


def _query_endpoint(
    endp:str, usr_agent:str, f:str,
    ) -> requests.models.Response:
    ...


def _handle_response(r: requests.models.Response) -> str:
    """Utility for handling reponse object & returning text content.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r : requests.models.Response
        Response returned from webAPI endpoint.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        Requested format `f` was not either 'text/plain' or 'application/json'. 
    requests.HTTPError
        HTTP error was encountered.
    """
    if r.ok:
        c_type = r.headers["Content-Type"]
        if c_type == "application/json":
            content = r.json()
            content = content["joke"]
        elif c_type == "text/plain":
            content = r.text
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(
                "This client accepts 'application/json' or 'text/plain' format"
                )
    else:
        raise requests.HTTPError(
            f"{r.status_code}: {r.reason}"
        )
    return content

```

Once `_query_endpoint()` gets us a response, we can feed it into
`_handle_response()`, where different logic is executed depending on the
response's properties. Specifically, any response we want to mock would need
the following:

1. headers, containing a dictionary eg: `{"content_type": "plain/text"}`
2. A `json()` method.
3. `text`, `status_code` and `reason` attributes.

Finally, the above functions get wrapped in the `get_joke()` function below:

```{python filename="example_pkg.only_joking.py"}
"""Retrieve dad jokes available."""
import requests


def _query_endpoint(
    endp:str, usr_agent:str, f:str,
    ) -> requests.models.Response:
    ...


def _handle_response(r: requests.models.Response) -> str:
    ...


def get_joke(
    endp:str = "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/",
    usr_agent:str = "datasavvycorner.com (https://github.com/r-leyshon/pytest-fiddly-examples)", 
    f:str = "text/plain",
) -> str:
    """Request a joke from icanhazdadjoke.com.

    Ask for a joke in either plain text or JSON format. Return the joke text.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endp : str, optional
        Endpoint to query, by default "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"
    usr_agent : str, optional
        User agent value, by default
        "datasavvycorner.com (https://github.com/r-leyshon/pytest-fiddly-examples)"
    f : str, optional
        Format to request eg "application.json", by default "text/plain"

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Joke text.
    """
    r = _query_endpoint(endp=endp, usr_agent=usr_agent, f=f)
    return _handle_response(r)

```

### Let's Get Testing

The behaviour in `get_joke()` is summarised in the flowchart below:

<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:500px;" src=/./www/15-pytest-mocking/01-control-flow.jpg alt="get_joke() logic flow">

There are 4 outcomes to check, coloured red and green in the process chart
above.

1. `get_joke()` successfully returns joke text when the user asked for json
format.
2. `get_joke()` successfully returns joke text when the user asked for plain
text.
3. `get_joke()` raises `NotImplementedError` if any other valid format is asked
for. Note that the API also accepts HTML and image formats, though parsing the
joke text out of those is more involved and beyond the scope of this blog.
4. `get_joke()` raises a `HTTPError` if the response from the API was not ok.

Note that the event that we wish to target for mocking is highlighted in blue - 
we don't want our tests to execute any real requests.

The strategy for testing this function without making requests to the web API
is composed of 4 similar steps, regardless of the package used to implement the
mocking. 

<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:800px;" src=/./www/15-pytest-mocking/02-mock-steps.jpg alt="4 step mocking strategy">

1.  **Mock:** Define the object or property that you wish to use as a
replacement. This could be a static value or something a bit more involved,
like a mock class that can return dynamic values depending upon the values it
receives. 
2. **Patch:** Replace part of the source code with our mock value. 
3. **Use:** Use the source code to return a value.
4. **Assert:** Check the returned value is what you expect.

In the examples that follow, I will label the equivalent steps for the various
mocking implementations.

### The "Ultimate Joke"

What hard-coded text shall I use for my expected joke? I'll
[create a fixture](/blogs/11-fiddly-bits-of-pytest.qmd) that will serve
up this joke text to all of the test modules used below. I'm only going to
define it once and then refer to it throughout several examples below. So it
needs to be a pretty memorable, awesome joke.

```{python filename="conftest.py"}
import pytest


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def ULTI_JOKE():
    return ("Doc, I can't stop singing 'The Green, Green Grass of Home.' That "
    "sounds like Tom Jones Syndrome. Is it common? Well, It's Not Unusual.")

```

Being a Welshman, I may be a bit biased. But that's a pretty memorable dad joke
in my opinion. This joke will be available to every test within my test suite
when I execute `pytest` from the command line. The assertions that we will
use when using `get_joke()` will expect this string to be returned. If some
other joke is returned, then we have not mocked correctly and an HTTP request
was sent to the API.

### Mocking Everything

I'll start with an example of how to mock `get_joke()` completely. This is an
intentionally bad idea. In doing this, the test won't actually be executing any
of the code, just returning a hard-coded value for the joke text. All this does
is prove that the mocking works as expected and has nothing to do with the
logic in our source code. 

So why am I doing it? Hopefully I can illustrate the most basic implementation
of mocking in this way. I'm not having to think about how I can mock a response
object with all the required properties. I just need to provide some hard coded
text. 

:::{.panel-tabset}

#### monkeypatch

```{python}
#| eval: false
import example_pkg.only_joking


def test_get_joke_monkeypatched_entirely(monkeypatch, ULTI_JOKE):
    """Completely replace the entire get_joke return value.

    Not a good idea for testing as none of our source code will be tested. But
    this demonstrates how to entirely scrub a function and replace with any
    placeholder value at pytest runtime."""
    # step 1
    def _mock_joke():
        """Return the joke text.

        monkeypatch.setattr expects the value argument to be callable. In plain
        English, a function or class."""
        return ULTI_JOKE
    # step 2
    monkeypatch.setattr(
        target=example_pkg.only_joking,
        name="get_joke",
        value=_mock_joke
        )
    # step 3 & 4
    # Use the module's namespace to correspond with the monkeypatch
    assert example_pkg.only_joking.get_joke() == ULTI_JOKE 

```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * Step 2 requires the hard coded text to be returned from a callable, like
    a function or class. So we define `_mock_joke` to serve the text in the
    required format.
* **Step 2**
    * `monkeypatch.setattr()` is able to take the module namespace that we
    imported as the target. This must be the namespace where the function
    (or variable etc) is defined.
* **Step 3**
    * When invoking the function, be sure to reference the function in the same
    way as it was monkeypatched.
    * Aliases can also be used if preferable
    (eg `import example_pkg.only_joking as jk`). Be sure to update your
    reference to `get_joke()` in step 2 and 3 to match your import statement.

#### MagicMock

```{python}
#| eval: false
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

import example_pkg.only_joking


def test_get_joke_magicmocked_entirely(ULTI_JOKE):
    """Completely replace the entire get_joke return value.

    Not a good idea for testing as none of our source code will be tested. But
    this demonstrates how to entirely scrub a function and replace with any
    placeholder value at pytest runtime."""
    # step 1
    _mock_joke = MagicMock(return_value=ULTI_JOKE)
    # step 2
    with patch("example_pkg.only_joking.get_joke", _mock_joke):
        # step 3
        joke = example_pkg.only_joking.get_joke()
        # step 4
        assert joke == ULTI_JOKE
```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * `MagicMock()` allows us to return static values as mock objects.
* **Step 3**
    * When you use `get_joke()`, be sure to call reference the namespace in the
    same way as to your patch in step 2.

:::

#### mockito

```{python}
#| eval: false
from mockito import when, unstub

import example_pkg.only_joking


def test_get_joke_mockitoed_entirely(ULTI_JOKE):
    """Completely replace the entire get_joke return value.

    Not a good idea for testing as none of our source code will be tested. But
    this demonstrates how to entirely scrub a function and replace with any
    placeholder value at pytest runtime."""
    # step 1 & 2
    when(example_pkg.only_joking).get_joke().thenReturn(ULTI_JOKE)
    # step 3
    joke = example_pkg.only_joking.get_joke()
    # step 4
    assert joke == ULTI_JOKE
    unstub()

```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1 & 2**
    * `mockito`'s intuitive `when(...).thenReturn(...)` pattern allows you
    to reference any object within the imported namespace. Like with
    `MagicMock`, the static string `ULTI_JOKE` can be referenced.
* **Step 3**
    * When you use `get_joke()`, be sure to call reference the namespace in the
    same way as to your patch in step 2.
* **unstub**
    * This step explicitly 'unpatches' `get_joke()`. If you did not `unstub()`,
    the patch to `get_joke()` would persist through the rest of your tests.
    * `mockito` allows you to implicitly `unstub()` by using the context
    manager `with`.

### `monkeypatch()` without OOP

Something I've noticed about the `pytest` documentation for `monkeypatch`, is
that it gets straight into mocking with Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
While this may be a bit more convenient, it is certainly not a requirement of
using `monkeypatch` and definitely adds to the cognitive load for new users.
This first example will mock the value of `requests.get` without using classes.

```{python}
#| eval: false
import requests

from example_pkg.only_joking import get_joke


def test_get_joke_monkeypatched_no_OOP(monkeypatch, ULTI_JOKE):
    # step 1: Mock the response object
    def _mock_response(*args, **kwargs):
        resp = requests.models.Response()
        resp.status_code = 200
        resp._content = ULTI_JOKE.encode("UTF8")
        resp.headers = {"Content-Type": "text/plain"}
        return resp
    
    # step 2: Patch requests.get
    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", _mock_response)
    # step 3: Use requests.get
    joke = get_joke()
    # step 4: Assert
    assert joke == ULTI_JOKE, f"Expected:\n'{ULTI_JOKE}\nFound:\n{joke}'"
    # will also work for json format
    joke = get_joke(f="application/json")
    assert joke == ULTI_JOKE, f"Expected:\n'{ULTI_JOKE}\nFound:\n{joke}'"

```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * The return value of `requests.get()` will be a response object. We need
    to mock this object with the methods and attributes required by the
    `_handle_response()` function. 
    * We need to encode the static joke text as bytes to format the data. 
    Response objects encode data as bytes for interoperatability and
    optimisation purposes.
* **step4**
    * As we have set an appropriate value for the mocked response's `_content`
    attribute, the mocked joke will be returned for both JSON and plain text
    formats - very convenient!

:::

### Condition 1: Test JSON

In this example, we demonstrate the same functionality as above, but the
`monkeypatch` example will use an object-oriented design pattern. This approach
more closely follows that of the `pytest` documentation. As before, `MagicMock`
and `mockito` examples will be included. 

The purpose of this test is to test the outcome of `get_joke()` when the user
specifies a json format.

    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", _mock_get_good_resp)
    # Step 3: Use
    j_json = get_joke(f="application/json")
    # Step 4: Assert
    assert j_json == ULTI_JOKE, f"Expected:\n'{ULTI_JOKE}\nFound:\n{j_json}'"

```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * We define a mocked class instance with the necessary properties expected
    by `_handle_response()`.
    * The mocked response is served to our test as a `pytest` fixture.
    * Within the test, we need another function, which will be able to take
    the arguments passed to `requests.get()`. This will allow our class
    instance to retrieve the appropriate header from the `HEADERS_MAP`
    dictionary.

As you may appreciate, this does not appear to be the most straight forward
implementation, but it will allow us to test when the user asks for JSON,
plain text or HTML formats. In the above test, we assert against JSON format
only.

#| eval: false
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

from example_pkg.only_joking import get_joke


def test_get_joke_json_magicmocked(ULTI_JOKE):
    """Test behaviour when user asked for JSON joke."""
    # step 1: Mock
    mock_response = MagicMock(spec=requests.models.Response)
    mock_response.ok = True
    mock_response.headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    mock_response.json.return_value = {"joke": ULTI_JOKE}

        # step 4: Assert
        assert joke == ULTI_JOKE

```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * `MagicMock()` can return a mock object with a specification designed to
    mock response objects. Super useful.
    * Our static joke content can be served directly to `MagicMock` without the
    need for an intermediate class.
    * In comparison to the `monkeypatch` approach, this appears to be more
    straight forward and maintainable.

#| eval: false
from mockito import when, unstub

def test_get_joke_json_mockitoed(ULTI_JOKE):
    """Test behaviour when user asked for JSON joke."""
    # step 1: Mock
    _mock_response = requests.models.Response()
    _mock_response.status_code = 200
    _mock_response._content = b'{"joke": "' + ULTI_JOKE.encode("utf-8") + b'"}'
    _mock_response.headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    # step 2: Patch
    when(requests).get(...).thenReturn(_mock_response)

    # step 4: Assert
    assert joke == ULTI_JOKE
    unstub()

```

:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * In order to encode the expected joke for JSON format, we need a
    dictionary encoded within a bytestring. This bit is a little tricky.
    * Alternatively, define the expected dictionary and use the `json`
    package. `json.dumps(dict).encode("UTF8")` will format the content
    dictionary in the required way.
* **Step 2**
    * `mockito`'s `when()` approach will allow you to access the methods of the
    object that is being patched, in this case `requests`. 
    * `mockito` allows you to pass the `...` argument to a patched method, to
    indicate that whatever arguments were passed to `get()`, return the
    specified mock value.
    * Being able to specify values passed in place of `...` will allow you to
    set different return values depending on argument values received by
    `get()`.

### Condition 3: Test Not Implemented

This test will check the outcome of what happens when the user asks for a
format other than text or JSON format. As the webAPI also offers image or HTML
formats, a response 200 (ok) would be returned from the service. But I was too
busy (lazy) to extract the text from those formats.

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * We can use the same mock class as for testing
    [Condition 1](#monkey-fixture), due to the content of the `HEADERS_MAP`
    dictionary.
* **Step 4**
    * We use a context manager (`with pytest.raises`) which catches the raised
    exception and stops it from terminating our `pytest` session. 
    * The asserted `match` argument can take a regular expression, so that
    wildcard patterns can be used. This allows matching of part of the
    exception message.

### Condition 4: Test Bad Response

In this test, we simulate a bad response from the webAPI, which could arise
for a number of reasons:

* The api is unavailable.
* The request asked for a resource that is not available.
* Too many requests were made in a short period.

These conditions are those that we have the least control over and therefore
have the greatest need for mocking.

    class MockBadResponse:
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.ok = False
            self.status_code = 404
            self.reason = "Not Found"
    return MockBadResponse

    monkeypatch, _mock_bad_response):

    with pytest.raises(requests.HTTPError, match="404: Not Found"):
        get_joke()

```


:::{.callout-note}

##### Notes

* **Step 1**
    * This time we need to define a new fixture that returns a bad response.
    * Alternatively, we could have implemented a single fixture for all of our
    tests that dynamically served a good or bad response dependent upon
    arguments passed to `get_joke()`, for example different string values
    passed as the endpoint.
    * In a more thorough implementation of `get_joke()`, you may wish to retry
    the request for certain HTTP error status codes. The ability to provide
    mocked objects that reliably serve those statuses allow you to
    deterministically validate your code's behaviour.

## Summary

We have thoroughly tested our code using approaches that mock the behaviour of
an external webAPI. We have also seen how to implement those tests with 3
different packages.

I hope that this has provided you with enough introductory material to begin
mocking tests if you have not done so before. If you find that your specific
use case for mocking is quite nuanced and fiddly (it's likely to be that way),
then the alternative implementations presented here can help you to understand
how to solve your specific mocking dilemma. 

One final quote for those developers having their patience tested by errors
attempting to implement mocking:

> "He who laughs last, laughs loudest."

...or she for that matter: Don't give up!
