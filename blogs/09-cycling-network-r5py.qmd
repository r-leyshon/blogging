## Introduction

[r<sup>5</sup>py is a relatively new transport modelling package](https://r5py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
available on PyPI. It provides convenient wrappers to
[Conveyal's r<sup>5</sup> Java library](https://github.com/conveyal/r5), a
performant routing engine originating from the ubiquitous Open Trip Planner
(OTP). Whereas r<sup>5</sup>py may not be as feature-rich as OTP, its unique
strength is in the production of origin:destination matrices at scale. This is
important if the intention is to produce stable statistics based on routing
algorithms, where the idiosyncracies of local transport service availability
means that departure times can have a significant impact upon overall journey
duration.

In summary, r<sup>5</sup>py achieves stable statistics by calculating travel
times over multiple journeys within a time window, returning insightful
summaries such as the median duration required to travel from point A to B.

### A Note on the Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to familiarise the reader with r<sup>5</sup>py
and how it integrates with the python geospatial ecosystem of packages. This
article is not to be used to attempt to infer service quality outcomes or to
inform policy decisions. Limitations of this analysis and suggested
improvements will be discussed throughout.
