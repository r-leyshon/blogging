## Introduction

This article will guide you through the process of building a Choose Your
Own Adventure game using ChatGPT and Python Shiny. We'll walk through the
entire journey, from concept to deployment, with a focus on the iterative
development process and the use of ChatGPT for generating storylines.

Choose Your Own Adventure is a classic storytelling format where the reader
is presented with a series of choices that guide the story in different
directions. The game is interactive, allowing the reader to make decisions
that affect the outcome of the story. They were popular in the 1980s and
early 1990s, widely available as graphic novels and comics with a fantasy
or adventure theme.

The aim of this project is to produce an interactive application that will
put the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to work. The model will generate the
branching outcomes depending on the choices made by the user. We will
provide the user with an introduction to the theme and we will provide the
model with the rules for the game. Each game will play out differently
depending on the creative interplay between the user and the model.

### Inspiration for This Blog (Click to expand)

The application concept was heavily influenced by the YouTube video by 
Tech with Tim called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYcTh6vw9A" target="_blank">Python AI Choose Your Own Adventure Game - Tutorial</a>.
This tutorial uses a more complicated stack behind the scenes and resulted
in a game that solved itself - essentially the model would also generate
'imagined' user responses through to completion. The tutorial was published
only 11 months ago at the time of writing, though the code would not run
without significant wiggling, due to a raft of breaking changes within
langchain.

I was inspired by the playful use of generative AI but could see that a few
things could be done to improve the reproducibility of the code. Also, by 
simplifying the stack required to generate the game responses, it is hoped
that the risk of deprecation and breaking changes will be reduced,
increasing the longevity of the code. Finally, an application would be
needed in order to allow the human player and model to take turns in
playing the game. I have opted to use 
<a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/" target="_blank">Shiny for Python</a>
in order to achieve this, though the same functionality could be achieved
with many other dashboarding solutions.

### Intended Audience

Python programmers who are curious about building LLM-enabled applications.
Some familiarity with Shiny may be assumed. For an overview and intro to
building Shiny apps with Python, chack out my other blogs:

- [The State of Python Shiny](/blogs/01-state-of-pyshiny.qmd)
- [Let's Build a Basic Python Shiny App](/blogs/02-getting-started-pyshiny.qmd)

### What You'll Need

- [ ] Command line access
- [ ] Python know-how
  - [ ] Configure a virtual environment
  - [ ] Dependency management
- [ ] Basic knowledge of Python Shiny
- [ ] An OpenAI API key

```{.abc filename=requirements.txt}
openai==1.30.4
shiny==1.1.0
shinyswatch==0.7.0

```

The final application is presented below, hosted with
<a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/" target="_blank">shinyapps.io</a>. You
will need an OpenAI API key in order to prompt the model. The app has a
link to the sign up page if you would like to give it a try. If you would
prefer to read the source code for the application before proceeding with
the article, then please click on the GitHub icon at the top-right of the
application. If you would rather interact with the application in a
full-sized window, then visit the
<a href="https://richleysh84.shinyapps.io/choose-adventure/" target="_blank">Jungle Quest app on shinyapps.io</a>.
This app is set up to query the gpt-3.5-turbo model, but as you proceed
through the tutorial, feel free to experiment with other available models
(they can behave quite differently).

</div>

## Setting up the Development Environment

I'd recommend using VSCode with the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Posit.shiny" target="_blank">Shiny extension</a>
to help run and debug the app. It has a super handy utility for launching
your app within the VSCode interface or expanding it to full screen in your
default browser. This is priceless when testing your User Interface's (UI)
appearance on different browsers.

You'll need to create and activate a virtual environment of your choice, I
have used python 3.12 in the examples without any issues. install the
dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, and finally ensure that
VSCode is configured to
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments" target="_blank">use the virtual environment</a>.

## Iterative Development

::: {.panel-tabset #iterations}

### Iteration 1

In this early prototype, we will focus on using the openai python client
to send a basic prompt to the gpt-3.5-turbo model.

```{.python filename=app.py}
"""Iteration 1: How to query the OpenAI API."""
import openai

API_KEY = "<INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE>"                                    # <1>


def query_openai(prompt: str, api_key: str) -> str:
    """Query the chat completions endpoint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prompt: str
        The prompt to query the chat completions endpoint with.
    api_key: str
        The API key to use to query the chat completions endpoint.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The response from the chat completions endpoint.
    """

    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)                           # <2>
    # need to handle cases where queries go wrong.
    try:                                                              # <3>
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[                                                # <4>
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}                   # <4>
            ]                                                         # <4>
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    # in cases where the API key is invalid.
    except openai.AuthenticationError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Is your API key valid?:\n {e}")



model_response = query_openai(
  prompt="What is the capital of the moon?", api_key=API_KEY
  )

```
1. Insert your API key into the API_KEY variable.
2. Create a new OpenAI client with the api_key.
3. This will only pass if the key provided is valid.
4. Note the format of the messages - a list of dictionaries. The value for
role can be "user", "system" or "assistant".

The model responds with:

> The moon does not have a capital as it is not a sovereign nation or
political entity.

Let's summarise the process with a diagram:

![Process diagram for iteration 1](https://i.imgur.com/t15T2J3.png)

So far we have a basic `query_openai()` function that we can feed in a
prompt and our api key. We then receive a response back from the openai
model with the expected content.

Although this is an extremely simple process, it's great to start off with
the fundamentals. Understanding the structure of what's being sent and
received is useful when we begin embedding this logic into our Shiny app.
