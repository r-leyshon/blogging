## Introduction

This article will guide you through the process of building a Choose Your
Own Adventure game using OpenAI generative AI models and Python Shiny.
We'll walk through the entire journey, from concept to deployment, with a
focus on the iterative development process and the use of ChatGPT for
generating storylines.

Choose Your Own Adventure is a classic storytelling format where the reader
is presented with a series of choices that guide the story in different
directions. The game is interactive, allowing the reader to make decisions
that affect the outcome of the story. They were popular in the 1980s and
early 1990s, widely available as graphic novels and comics with a fantasy
or adventure theme.

The aim of this project is to produce an interactive application that will
use AI to generate the branching outcomes depending on the choices made by
the user. We will provide the user with an introduction to the theme and we
will provide the model with the rules for the game. Each game will play out
differently depending on the creative interplay between the user and the
model.

### Inspiration for This Blog (Click to expand)

The application concept was heavily influenced by the YouTube video by 
Tech with Tim called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYcTh6vw9A" target="_blank">Python AI Choose Your Own Adventure Game - Tutorial</a>.
This tutorial uses a more complicated stack behind the scenes and resulted
in a game that solved itself - essentially the model would also generate
'imagined' user responses through to completion. The tutorial was published
only 11 months ago at the time of writing, though the code would not run
without significant adaptation, due to a raft of breaking changes within
`langchain`.

I was inspired by the playful use of generative AI but could see that a few
things could be done to improve the reproducibility of the code. Also, by 
simplifying the stack required to generate the game responses, it is hoped
that the risk of deprecation and breaking changes will be reduced,
increasing the longevity of the code. Finally, an application would be
needed in order to allow the human player and model to take turns in
playing the game. I have opted to use 
<a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/" target="_blank">`shiny` for Python</a>
in order to achieve this, though the same functionality could be achieved
with many other dashboarding solutions.

### A Note on the Purpose (Click to expand)

This article intends to discuss clearly. It doesn't aim to be clever or
impressive. Its aim is to extend understanding without overwhelming the
reader. The code may not always be optimal, favouring a simplistic approach
wherever possible. The application may not be to your liking. The purpose
is to help learners build a simple AI-driven application rather than a
masterpiece. If you have ideas for improvements to the app or blog, please
feel free to leave a comment at the end of the article.

:::

The final application is presented below, hosted with
<a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/" target="_blank">shinyapps.io</a>.
Please note, this is not configured for high traffic. Let me know if the
app fails to launch for you by leaving a comment at the end of the blog.
You will need an OpenAI API key in order to prompt the model. The app has a
link to the sign up page if you would like to give it a try.

If you would prefer to read the source code for the application before
proceeding with the article, then please click on the GitHub icon at the
top-right of the application. If you would rather interact with the
application in a full-sized window, then visit
<a href="https://richleysh84.shinyapps.io/choose-adventure/" target="_blank">Jungle Quest app on shinyapps.io</a>.
This app is set up to query the gpt-3.5-turbo model, but as you proceed
through the tutorial, feel free to experiment with other available models
(they can behave quite differently).

<iframe class=iframey src="https://richleysh84.shinyapps.io/choose-adventure/" style="overflow:hidden;margin:0;padding:0;width:100%;height:50rem"></iframe>

## Setting up the Development Environment

I'd recommend using <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/ target="_blank">VSCode</a> with the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Posit.shiny" target="_blank">`shiny` extension</a>
to help run and debug the app. It has a handy utility for launching your
app within the VSCode interface or expanding it to full screen in your
default browser. This is priceless when testing your User Interface's (UI)
appearance on different browsers.

You'll need to create and activate a virtual environment of your choice, I
have used python 3.12 in the examples without any issues. install the
dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, and finally ensure that
VSCode is configured to
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments" target="_blank">use the virtual environment</a>.

## Iterative Development

::: {.callout-caution}

Take care with your OpenAI APi credentials. I demonstrate hard-coding these
credentials within python scripts for simplicity. I'd advise storing them
in a git-ignored secrets file or using the
<a href=https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/ target="_blank">`python-dotenv`</a>
package to keep them safe. Take care not to accidentally commit these
credentials and expose them on GitHub. Leakage of OpenAI credentials is the
fastest-growing type of secret leak, according to
<a href=https://www.gitguardian.com/state-of-secrets-sprawl-report-2024 target="_blank">Git Guardian's State of Secret Sprawl 2024</a>.

Finally, please note that usage of the openai service is associated with
your account via your API key. Please conform to the
<a href="https://openai.com/policies/" target="_blank">service's usage policy.</a>

Let's gradually build on the logic until we have a fully functional app.

### Iteration 1

In this early prototype, we will focus on using the openai python client
to send a basic prompt to the gpt-3.5-turbo model. 

```{.python filename=app.py}
"""Iteration 1: How to query the OpenAI API."""
import openai

API_KEY = "<INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE>"                                    # <1>


def query_openai(prompt: str, api_key: str) -> str:
    """Query the chat completions endpoint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prompt: str
        The prompt to query the chat completions endpoint with.
    api_key: str
        The API key to use to query the chat completions endpoint.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The response from the chat completions endpoint.
    """

    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)                           # <2>
    # need to handle cases where queries go wrong.
    try:                                                              # <3>
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[                                                # <4>
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}                   # <4>
            ]                                                         # <4>
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    # in cases where the API key is invalid.
    except openai.AuthenticationError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Is your API key valid?:\n {e}")



model_response = query_openai(
  prompt="What is the capital of the moon?", api_key=API_KEY
  )

```
1. Insert your API key into the API_KEY variable. Note - it's not advisable
to include your secret credentials in your python scripts like this, but
for simplicity's sake, I'm showing that here. Take care not to accidentally
commit these credentials and expose them on GitHub.
2. Creates a new OpenAI client with the api_key. This client can be reused
to send queries to the different service endpoints.
3. This will only pass if the key provided is valid.
4. Note the format of the messages - a list of dictionaries. The value for
role can be "user", "system" or "assistant".

The model responds with:

> The moon does not have a capital as it is not a sovereign nation or
political entity.

Let's summarise the process with a diagram:

![Process diagram for iteration 1](https://i.imgur.com/t15T2J3.png)

So far we have a basic `query_openai()` function that we can feed in a
prompt and our api key. We then receive a response back from the openai
model with the expected content.

Although this is an extremely simple process, it's great to start off with
the fundamentals. Understanding the structure of what's being sent and
received is useful when we begin embedding this logic into our `shiny` app.

### Iteration 2

In this iteration, we are going to introduce a system message to help guide
the behaviour of the model - we want the model to act as the guide on an
adventure. We'll also need it to follow a few rules such as how to indicate
the game is over.

```{.python filename=app.py}
"""Iteration 2: Add system & welcome prompts."""
import openai

API_KEY = "<INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE>"
_SYSTEM_MSG = """

journey through the Amazon Rainforest. Your job is to create compelling

branching narrative experience where each of the player's choices leads to

2. Ask the player to provide a name, gender and race.
3. Ask the player to choose from a selection of weapons that will be used
later in the game.
4. Have a few paths that lead to success. 
5. Have some paths that lead to death.
6. Whether or not the game results in success or death, the response must   # <2>
include the text "The End...", I will search for this text to end the game. # <2>

```
1. Certain models can get a bit overzealous and start providing imagined
user input, ultimately playing the game through to completion on their own.
As games go, that's not particularly fun, so let's try to safeguard against
that behaviour with these explicit instructions.
2. The gpt-3.5-turbo model seems to be pretty reliable at ending the game
with the required pattern "The end...". We'll later search for this pattern
to exit the app and return a message indicating game over. Interestingly, 
I found gpt-4 models to be fairly unreliable in following this instruction.
All of the models can be configured to stream their responses too, in which
case they rarely gave the specified game over pattern. I'd be interested in
others' opinions as to why this may be the case. Please feel free to leave
a comment at the end of the article if you have an opinion.
3. This welcome message will be used to introduce the game context for our
users when the app launches. We will append this into the message stream
and simulate the LLM greeting our user. We will also include this message
when querying the model, where it will serve as what's known as a one-shot
prompt to help guide the model's behaviour. A one-shot prompt is an example
of how you'd like the model to behave.
4. We update the messages stream with our hard-coded prompts. This helps to
guide both the model and the user, setting context and modelling the
desired behaviour.

Thanks to the guidance in the hard-coded prompts, our model now behaves a
bit differently:

> I'm afraid the Moon doesn't have a capital city like countries on Earth
do! Let's focus on our adventure in the Amazon Rainforest. To begin, please
choose your name, gender, and race. Additionally, select a weapon to arm
yourself with on this mystical journey. The fate of finding the lost Crown
of Quetzalcoatl awaits your choices!

Notice that the model still answers the question, but guides the user back
to the purpose of the app. In a later iteration, we will see how to
introduce moderations as a safeguard against the user passing inappropriate
content.

Finally, updating our process diagram to include the additional prompts, I
have emphasised the changes implemented within this iteration. As we
proceed, the diagram's complexity will increase and therefore I'll try to
emphasise the changes implemented over the previous iteration only:

![Process diagram for iteration 2](https://i.imgur.com/6vuOSp5.png)

### Iteration 3

This time, we'll put together the basic UI for the app. The UI needs a text
field to pass the user's API key and the chat component. Let's update the
app script to include the `shiny` UI.

```{.python filename="app.py"}
"""Iteration 3: A basic user interface with no server logic."""
import openai
from shiny import App, ui

_SYSTEM_MSG = """

# Shiny User Interface ----------------------------------------------------

app_ui = ui.page_fillable(                                                  # <1>
    ui.panel_title("Choose Your Own Adventure: Jungle Quest!"),
    ui.accordion(                                                           # <2>
    ui.accordion_panel("Step 1: Your OpenAI API Key",
        ui.input_text(id="key_input", label="Enter your openai api key"),   # <3>
    ), id="acc", multiple=False),
    ui.chat_ui(id="chat"),                                                  
    fillable_mobile=True,
)

app = App(app_ui, server=None)                                              # <4>
```
1. `ui.page_fillable()` Works well with a chat component, increasing the
height of your app to accommodate a growing chat log.
2. The `ui.accordion()` component will present a collapsible panel. This
will be useful for the key input panel - we can minimise the key input once
finished with it and focus on the chat.
3. In `shiny` UI elements, the first argument is usually the `id`. If you
know CSS and HTML, then it's the same `id` you'd target for styling an
element. It's really important in `shiny` as the server logic we'll write
later will communicate data to the UI via these `id` values. Make sure the
`id` values are unique and do not include hyphens - use underscores
instead.
4. In this final step, we need to combine our UI with server logic to make
things work. As we haven't written any server logic yet, we can just pass
`None`. This means our UI won't do anything in its current state.

Feel free to play around with the code and re-run the app using the play
icon in the top-right corner of `app.py`. This interface uses the
<a href="https://shinylive.io/py/examples/" target="_blank">shinylive service</a>
which is useful for sharing simple `shiny` apps without any need for python
installations.

The process diagram for our app so far looks like this:

![Process diagram for iteration 3](https://i.imgur.com/ToBp4iQ.png)

Our logic for talking to the OpenAI model has not yet been coupled with our
UI. We'll fold that logic into our `shiny` server in the next iteration.

### Iteration 4

In this part, we'll take the logic from the `query_openai()` function
defined in iteration 1 and use it to build our `shiny` server. The `shiny`
server is typically referenced as the "backend" to our app.

```{.python filename="app.py"}

```
1. To keep a running log of what's been said, we assign chat messages to
a `stream` list. When the user and model respond, we'll dump that content
as a dictionary at the end of this list.
2. Here we create the backend to our `shiny` chat interface. It's vital
that it has the same `id` value as the `ui.chat_ui()` element defined in
our UI in iteration 3. This connection will allow the backend and frontend
to communicate when we run the app.
3. We use async here because it improves responsiveness, especially when
dealing with potentially slow network requests to the OpenAI API.
4. We've now switched over to the OpenAI Async client. This is better for
working with event driven apps like this one. We no longer hard-code an API
key. Instead, we'll take the value from the `ui.input_text()` field. Notice
that we reference the `id` value that we set when we defined the UI like a
method call: `input.key_input()`. This is how `shiny` apps wire the 
frontend and backend together.
5. We need to use `await` in parts of our server logic. This is because the
model response typically takes some time to arrive and parts of the server
would error until they receive it. Typically, anything that would raise an
exception rather than returning `None` you'll need to `await` in a `shiny`
app.
6. This part of our server is where we end the game. Notice that this is
dependent on our model following rule 6 in `_SYSTEM_MSG`. Not all models
are great at following that instruction. At the time of writing this blog,
I've tested `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o` and `chatgpt-4o-latest`. In my
testing I found `gpt-3.5-turbo` to be the most reliable at following this
rule. But when I tested streaming the model responses, no models would end
the game as requested. This is definitely the most flaky element of this
app and is part of the fun of working with these models.

Updating the server logic for our process diagram, note that I have added a
key that illustrates wherever we instantiate an openai client in the app.
As we continue to build, handling the client becomes a bit involved so
let's start paying attention to wherever we're using it:

![Process diagram for iteration 4](https://i.imgur.com/46mqCrY.png)

You can see that the `respond()` function has become the busiest unit in
the app. It takes the api key value from our UI, combines the user's
messages sent from the chat UI, adds these to the chat stream and
communicates with the OpenAI model. Now these components are all wired up
we get a running application. If you've made it this far - well done!

You can see me interacting with the resultant app in the video below. Note
that I cannot use shinylive to host a working version of this iteration as
unfortunately the `openai` package is not available on that service. 

:::{.callout-important}

I use a real OpenAI API key in these clips to demonstrate the application.
Note that I have since revoked this key and it will no longer work. You
should not share your secret keys with anyone.

:::

<iframe title="Iteration 4 recording" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1010110793?h=133c2b081d" class=iframey allowfullscreen style="overflow:hidden;margin:0;padding:0;width:100%;height:24rem;"></iframe>

Notice that I attempt to use a nonsense key value and we get a
nasty-looking error. Luckily, it's not a fatal one - the app doesn't crash.
But we should think about handling cases where the key is bad and give a
more accessible notification to the user instead. 

### Iteration 5

In this version, we build on our working app to improve the user
experience. We'll add a 'submit' button, which the user can use when
they're ready to use their key. We also provide notifications to the
user when they submit their key, but we won't be checking whether the key
is valid until the next iteration.

```
1. Here we define a new function that's used to conveniently return a text
field and an action button together. This is what we'll use for the key
input going forward.
2. Notice that the `id` value that we'll pass into
`input_text_with_button()` will return separate unique `id` values for the
text field and action button.
3. Feel free to experiment with styling any elements with CSS. If you'd
rather not have inline CSS, you can move the styling into a dedicated CSS
file and apply it with classes or IDs to the elements in your UI.
4. We replace the text field of previous iterations with our new
`input_text_with_button()` text field & action button combo.
5. In the server, we define a new function that will run whenever the
action button with `id=input.key_input_btn` is clicked by the user. If
there's a value that's been submitted we're going to place a confirmation
notification on the UI. If not, we'll raise a warning to the user to remind
them to submit their key.

I've added a marker in the process diagram to remind us that
`handle_api_key_submit()` will run as a reactive event when the key is
submitted. This function updates the UI with feedback notifications.

![Process diagram for iteration 5](https://i.imgur.com/lU743ra.png)

:::{.callout-tip}

Using `ui_notification_show()` is a really useful method for debugging
reactive values when your app breaks. Use it to check on intermediate
values that the frontend receives from the backend.

:::

:::{.callout-important}

I use a real OpenAI API key in these clips to demonstrate the application
working. Note that I have since revoked this key and it will no longer
work. You should not share your secret keys with anyone.

:::

In the recording below, you can see the new action button and the UI
notifications being returned by the server. However, note that I still get
that nasty red error when I pass an invalid key. In the next iteration,
we'll determine whether the user has used a valid key.

```
1. Notice that we are now creating another openai client. This is so that
we can test the key to see whether it successfully queries the openai
service, before using it to play the game. Initiating multiple clients is
not needed and is inefficient design. In a later iteration we'll come back
to this.
2. This time, we'll query the `models.list()` endpoint to get a list of
models available. There is currently no OpenAI endpoint for explicitly
checking whether a service is valid. OpenAI API support team responded to
my support ticket to suggest this as the best method for ensuring a key is
valid.
3. In cases where a bad key is provided, we can avoid the
`openai.AuthenticationError` and print a warning to the UI instead.

In our increasingly complex process diagram, I've emphasised that
`handle_api_key_submit()` now instantiates another client object and uses
it to query the `models.list` endpoint of the OpenAI service.

![Process diagram for iteration 6](https://i.imgur.com/Tb7jjeK.png)

:::{.callout-important}

I use a real OpenAI API key in these clips to demonstrate the application
working. Note that I have since revoked this key and it will no longer
work. You should not share your secret keys with anyone.

:::

In the recording below I demonstrate how this version of the app will
return a warning to the user if the submitted key was not valid.

<iframe title="Iteration 6 recording" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1010111977?h=b625a6f9ef" class=iframey allowfullscreen style="overflow:hidden;margin:0;padding:0;width:100%;height:24rem;"></iframe>

### Iteration 7

Now we introduce a moderation feature that will check that the prompts
being passed from the user to the OpenAI service comply with the service's
usage policies. Forewarned - this is far from perfect!

In general, it's pretty good but if you're intentionally trying to test it
like I did when implementing this feature, you can find some funny quirks.
British expletives tend to sail through unchallenged and at times my test
prompts were raised as violations for stating things like "Let's fight!"
(category: harassment) when that was one of the options provided to me by
the model! It's likely that passing greater context to the moderations
endpoint (such as more of the message stream) may be able to overcome this,
though that has not been implemented for this tutorial.

```
1. We define a new function that will query the OpenAI moderations
endpoint.
2. Notice that we create a third openai client in order to handle the
communication with the service. In the next iteration we will refactor
this.
3. If the prompt has violated any category, then the value of the `flagged`
key will be `True`.
4. In cases where multiple categories are violated, we will include each
breached category in a message to the user.
5. The return value in the case of a prompt that passes the moderation
check.
6. We implement some control flow to query the `chat.completions` endpoint
only if the moderations check passes.

The updated process diagram clarifies the reactive flow of the app. Now
prompts from the user pass through `check_moderations()` first. The outcome
of check moderations is then passed along within the `respond()` function,
determining whether the prompt would be passed along to the
`chat.completions` endpoint.

:::{.callout-important}

I use a real OpenAI API key in these clips to demonstrate the application
working. Note that I have since revoked this key and it will no longer
work. You should not share your secret keys with anyone.

:::

When using this iteration of the app, you can see that certain prompts may
now be flagged as inappropriate. Note that this also reduces the
performance of our app, as we need to send and process 2 queries for each
prompt that the user enters.

application to ensure we use a single openai client to query the separate
endpoints.

```
1. `shiny`
<a href=https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/core/reactive.value.html target="_blank">reactive values</a>
are often good choices for objects that you intend to update at multiple
points within a `shiny` server. Here we are defining an empty reactive value
that we can subsequently use to store and access an openai client.
2. It's a subtle change, but now if the client returns a list of models,
validating the api key that the user passed, then we set that client as the
return value of `openai_client`.
3. The `check_moderations()` function expects to receive the reactive value
object and will use it to `.get()` the stored client.
4. This is the last occasion that we access the reactive client value. We
initiated the client once and used it in three places to query 3 different
endpoints.

This refactoring reduces the complexity of the app, ensuring that once the
api key has been validated, that same openai client will be passed to the
`moderations` and `chat.completions` endpoints.

```
1. In order to set a theme we import
<a href=https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shinyswatch target="_blank">`shinyswatch`</a>.
2. Markdown or HTML that you pass to the chat interface will get rendered.
This includes images, links and even emojis. In fact, one of the gpt-4o
models I tested decided to respond with emojis.
3. Popping this one-liner in your UI will apply the theme styling to your
application. Feel free to select any of the available options, see the
interactive theme selector app below for all available themes.

`shinyswatch` is a great utility that allows for efficient styling of
python `shiny` apps. Check out this shinylive app from the package
maintainers that allows you to easily toggle between the different themes
available.

I use a real OpenAI API key in these clips to demonstrate the application
working. Note that I have since revoked this key and it will no longer
work. You should not share your secret keys with anyone.

The final app is demonstrated in full below.

## Conclusion

Finally, we have arrived at the end of the application development! We
started out with a basic little script that demonstrated how to use the
`openai` python client and have arrived at a fully functional game with
some additional safeguards against misuse. If you've stuck with it this far
- well done, I'd say you've earned yourself a pat on the back! 

<div hidden>{{< fa hands-clapping >}}</div><i class="fa-solid fa-hands-clapping fa-beat fa-2xl" style="color:#ffa53d;text-align:center;display:inline-block;width:100%;"></i>

If you'd like to continue improving the app, then here are some
suggestions:

- Pass more context to the moderations endpoint to minimise false
positives.
- Add a temperature control, so that the user can adjust how creative the
models can be.
- Add a model selection widget so that the user can try out responses with
different openai models.
- Experiment with
<a href=https://github.com/r-leyshon/adventure-app/tree/stream-example target="_blanks">streaming the responses</a>
for a more responsive design.
- Restructure your app to make use of
<a href=https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/modules.html target="_blank">`shiny` modules</a>,
increasing the application's maintainability.

I hope you've enjoyed the tutorial and learned something new. If you're
able to riff off this with your own designs I would be really interested to
take a look - please feel free to post links to your own creations in the
comments at the end of the blog. If you'd like to consider how to share
your app with others, take a look at my article on
[Deployment to Shinyapps.io](/blogs/07-schedule-deploy-shinyapps.qmd).
