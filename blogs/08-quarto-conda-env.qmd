## Introduction

This article sets out minimal instructions on rendering quarto documents that
rely on specified conda virtual environments. This article collates information
from:

- <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html#using-conda" target="_blank">Quarto Documentation: Using Conda</a>
- <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#kernel-selection" target="_blank">Quarto Documentation: Using Python</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels#use-with-nbconvert-voila-papermill" target="_blank">nb_conda_kernels readme</a>

It is presumed that you will be working within a git repository at times. If
this is not the case, ignoring steps specifying git instructions should not
affect your ability to successfully render the quarto documents.

### A Note on the Purpose

The purpose of this article is not to explore reasons for using conda
enviroments or to compare the pros and cons of the many different options for
managing python virtual environments. It aims to help the reader configure
quarto documents to run with a specified conda environment while remaining
minimal, opting to link to sources of further information where discussion may
complement the content.

:::

### Intended Audience

Python practitioners familiar with conda environment management
@CondaDocsEnvMgmt who are less familiar working with quarto documents
@HelloQuarto.

### The Scenario

You are writing a quarto document that contains python code. You would like to
use conda to manage your python dependencies. You are encountering problems in 
having quarto select the appropriate conda environment.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}

#### Named Environments

This article covers having quarto execute with "prefix" conda environments.
This setup may be useful specifically for a website where different site pages
have different dependencies.

However, many readers may wish for a simpler solution. It is possible to have
quarto websites and documents execute with a named environment instead. If you
have an environment created like below:

`conda create -n my-awesome-env python -y`

Then including the following statement within either the _quarto.yml or quarto
document's YAML header should be enough to guarantee that the target
environment is picked up when rendering:

`jupyter: my-awesome-env`

Additionally, if you would just prefer the site or document to render with
whatever version of python is available in
**the currently active environment**, then use:

`jupyter: python3`

Many thanks to Ethan for this tip.

### What You'll Need:

- [ ] Conda or miniconda
- [ ] Quarto
- [ ] Text editor eg VS Code
- [ ] Python package manager (eg `pip`)
- [ ] Access to a command line interface (CLI) such as terminal / Bash.
- [ ] `requirements.txt`:

```{.python filename=requirements.txt eval=false}
nbclient
nbformat
palmerpenguins

```
- [ ] git (optional)

## Configuring Quarto with Conda Env

### Project Structure

1. Create a new project folder. Open a terminal and change directory to the new
project.
2. Save the requirements to a `requirements.txt` file.
3. Create a new quarto document in the project root. In VS Code, use  
`File` {{< fa arrow-right >}} `New File...` {{< fa arrow-right >}}
`Quarto Document`.
4. Write the following content to a python code chunk in the quarto file and
save as `penguins.qmd`
```{.python filename="penguins.qmd" eval=False}
df = penguins.load_penguins().dropna()
df.head()
```
### Configure the Environment

5. Create a new conda environment with the `-p` flag and give it a suitably
descriptive name [^1]. Ensure that the environment is built with python 3.11
[^2].
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
conda create -p SOME_ENV_NAME python=3.11 -y
```
6. Activate the environment.
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
conda activate ./SOME_ENV_NAME
```
7. Install the requirements file.
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8. Add a `.gitignore` file and include the name of the local environment
directory created in step 4.
```{.zsh filename=.gitignore eval=False}
SOME_ENV_NAME/
```

### Configure the Quarto Project

9. Create a `_quarto.yml` configuration file in the project root. In this file,
we will specify that the `quarto render` command should render any qmd files
and ignore any files found within your local environment.
Add the
following content:
```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yaml" eval=False}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
  render:
    - "*.qmd"
    - "!/./SOME_ENV_NAME/"

```
10. Use conda to install the `nb_conda_kernels` package. This is used to manage
python jupyter kernels for notebooks.
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
conda install nb_conda_kernels
```
11. Copy the path returned from the below command
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
jupyter --config-dir
```
12. Create a `jupyter_config.json` in the jupyter config directory:
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
touch <INSERT_YOUR_CONFIG_DIR>/jupyter_config.json
```
13. Write the below content to this file and save.
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
echo -e "{\n  "CondaKernelSpecManager": {\n    "kernelspec_path": "--user"\n  }\n}" >> <INSERT_YOUR_CONFIG_DIR>/jupyter_config.json
```
14. Run the below command to return a list of available kernels:
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
python -m nb_conda_kernels list
```
15. Copy the name (not the path) for the environment that you created with the
format `conda-env-<YOUR_ENV_NAME>-py`.
16. Open `penguins.qmd`. Adjust the YAML header so that it contains the
following:
```{.yaml filename=penguins.qmd eval=False}
jupyter: 
  kernelspec:
    name: "conda-env-<YOUR_ENV_NAME>-py"
    language: "python"
    display_name: "<YOUR_ENV_NAME>"

```
17. You should now be able to render the quarto project, confirming that the
target environment was activated in the CLI output. eg:
```{.zsh filename=CLI eval=False}
quarto render
```

```
Starting <YOUR_ENV_NAME> kernel...Done
```

[^1]: When creating conda environments, the use of generic names such as `env`
will result in conda prepending the environment name with numbers to avoid
conflicts. Use descriptive environment names in order to avoid
this, eg `penguins-env`.
[^2]: `nb_conda_kernels` (a package required in
[a later step](#configure-the-quarto-project)) does not currently work with
python 3.12 or newer.

### Tips

* When encountering issues with quarto render, it can be informative to examine
the output of `quarto check` or `quarto check jupyter` in the CLI.
* As there are many steps to configuring conda, it may be a good idea to create
a dedicated conda environment for all of your quarto projects. Quarto attempts
to select an appropriate kernel based upon the content of the first executable
python code chunk in your quarto document. Usually, this chunk would contain
the import statements. However, over time this would likely result in package
conflicts over time.
* The approach set out in this how-to would be a good fit for a website built
with quarto, where the configuration steps can be performed only once in a
parent website environment, and then specific, minimal environments created for
each article requiring a python environment.
* Alternatively, consider using `venv` or `poetry` to manage python
environments @DO4DSPKGLayer for quarto projects.

## Troubleshooting

* You've created a new environment and it is not discovered when running
`python -m nb_conda_kernels list`:
  * Activate your new environment
  * `pip install ipykernel`
  * Run:
  ```{zsh}
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name <INSERT_ENV_NAME> --display-name "<INSERT_DISPLAY_NAME>"
  ```
  * Deactivate the new environment.
  * Run `python -m nb_conda_kernels list` once more and the new env should
  appear.

## Conclusion

This article has walked the reader through setting up a basic quarto project,
creating a conda environment, and configuring a quarto document to render with
a specified environment. For more help with quarto, consult the quarto-cli
GitHub repository @QuartoCLI and the RStudio Community @PositCommunity (soon to
rebrand to the Posit Community).
