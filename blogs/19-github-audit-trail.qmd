## Introduction

Most developers spend time reading other people's code - for Pull
Reviews (PRs) or to learn more about an Application Programming Interface
(API), for example. Every so often, a developer may need to review an
entire repository and possibly even its commit history. This can happen
when publishing a mature codebase.

Making sennse of other peoples' commit histories can be challenging,
especially if that work is exploratory. Understanding the myriad reasons
for any single change after the fact is reliant upon whether the developer
had time to document their reasons for their implementation. Even if you work alone, perhaps that other developer
will be yourself at times. Needing to pick through your code's commit
history in order to find a bug-free version. 

The good news is that there are a few tools that GitHub can provide us, and
one or two easy habits that will greatly assist your colleagues' in
comprehending your Git activity. In fact, the GitHub User Interface (UI) is
designed in subtle ways, to nudge you towards some of these behaviours. The
sort of things that are not required but are incredibly helpful to others - 
including your future self.

In my opinion, Jerry really should have included "...your future self..."
in there, too. Read on for more on how to be kind to yourself, and those
poor souls who need to read your work - GitHub has your back.
