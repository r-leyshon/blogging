## Introduction

For people who use Quarto to build their websites, there are a few options for
adding commenting functionality to their site. This allows your readers to engage
with your site, leaving text or emoji feedback. Quarto currently offers built-in
support for three commenting widgets. This article compares their functionality,
linking to minimal implementations of each.

For full details on how to implement each commenting solution, please consult the
[Quarto commenting documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting).

This article was written with Quarto 1.5.56. Some of the commenting solutions explored
in this article are in development and may change in the future.


### Intended Audience

Programmers with a working knowledge of quarto websites, considering options for
adding commenting features to their site.

### What You'll Need

- [ ] [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/download/index.html)
- [ ] Command line access

## Hypothes.is

Hypothes.is is a great new, feature-rich social annotation solution. It has a strong
[commitment to open source](https://web.hypothes.is/about/). After exploring its main
features, I would suggest it is aimed at a broad audience with strong features for academic
audiences, particularly cohorts of students that will benefit from group analysis
of documents.

For users to interact with the Hypothes.is interface, they will need to create an
account and login, though this is not a painful process and will prevent excess spam on your site.
An example of a minimal quarto website with hypothes.is enabled is below - feel free to test the
commenting features yourself. Click on the arrow in the top-right hand corner to
expand the Hypothes.is user interface. Code for the site is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/r-leyshon/quarto-hypothesis).

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple setup, just include the Hypothesis portion in your site's YAML & render.                |
| Private highlighting.                                                                          |
| Private notetaking if you create a private group. Other members can be invited to participate. |
| Toggle on/off highlights and comments separately.                                              |
| Annotations - linked specifically to a region of text in the article.                          |
| Page notes - applied to an entire page.                                                        |
| Annotations and page notes can be tagged with additional metadata.                             |
| Revisions are easy and built into the UI.                                                      |
| Collapsible UI is neat, reducing clutter.                                                      |
| Browser extension available.                                                                   |
| Compatible with sites deployed from other repo-hosting solutions, eg GitLab, BitBucket.        |

Hypothesis Observations
:::

## Utterances

Utterances uses GitHub Issues to store comment data. If you are deploying your site from GitHub
and are not making good use of the repo issues, this could be a viable option. It's important to
note that your users will need a GitHub account and to authenticate in order to post comments on
your site. For more on utterances, please consult the
[utteranc.es documentation](https://utteranc.es/). In order to read and write issues on your repo,
you do need to allow the [Utterances GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) permission.
Without doing this, the Utterances UI will appear on your site but will not function correctly.
Code for A minimal Quarto site with Utterances is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/r-leyshon/quarto-utterances). The site can be viewed below.

| Either give it global access to all repos or selected repos.                                   |
| User must sign into GitHub and authorize the utterances app.                                   |
| Markdown compatibility as per usual GitHub issues.                                             |
| User must sign into GitHub and authorize the utterances app.                                   |

| Reactions to comments with emojis.                                                             |
| Revisions are possible though are not achievable through the website UI. By navigating to the  |
| repo issues, you can edit any comment that was authored by your account.                       |

| Every comment creates a GitHub issue on the repo â€“ 1 per page of your site. May be a bit noisy |
| Marking issues as closed does not remove them from the site.                                   |
| Deleting the issue from the repo will remove the comment but may also mess up the mapping of   |
| comments to pages. May cause issues moderating.                                                |
| Couldn't get the labels feature to work, despite creating the issue label of the same name, as |

Utterances Observations

## Giscus

Giscus emulates the Utterances functionality, but by using the new(ish) GitHub Discussions feature
as the comment database, instead of the repo issues. The [Giscus documentation](https://giscus.app/)
currently states the widget is in development, as well as the GitHub API that it relies on, so
expect some changes with this solution. In the same way as Utterances, you will need to give the
[Giscus GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/giscus) permissions to read and write repo metadata.
Users will also require a GitHub account in order to authenticate. Code for A minimal quarto site
with Giscus is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/r-leyshon/quarto-giscus).
The site can be viewed below.

| Activate discussions on your repo or give it global access to all repos.                       |
| Allows emoji reactions to articles or comments on articles.                                    |
| Allows text responses to specific comments.                                                    |

: Pros {#tbl-first .striped .hover .tabley}

|                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Like utterances, Giscus revisions are possible only through the GitHub UI. By navigating to    |
| the GitHub repo discussions tab, you can edit any post authored by your account.               |
| Changing configuration (e.g., mapping: pathname to mapping: URL) will cause old Giscus         |
| comments to be lost from your site. Though they are still available in the repo under the      |
| discussions tab.                                                                               |

Giscus Observations

## Summary

Overall, I felt that hypothesis offered the greatest functionality. However,
it also presents a new service for your audience to subscribe to. If like me,
your target audience consists mainly of programmers, then it is likely they
will already have access to GitHub accounts. 

Comparing GitHub Utterances with Giscus, I considered the greater functionality
and look of Giscus to be just a little better than Utterances. Therefore I opted
for this solution, though will keep it under review incase breaking changes make
things less helpful.

It's great that the Quarto development team have implemented support for several
commenting solutions. Although there are a great variety of solutions available
to site maintainers and implementing any of these solutions should be possible
as quarto document metadata is fully customisable.
