## TL;DR

It's more secure to reference GitHub Actions written by others by referring
to the commit hash of the code than the version. Particularly if the action
requires access to a secret credential. For example:

```{.yaml filename="upload-codecov.yml"}
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@main
- uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }} # required
```

...is more safely referenced like below:

```{.yaml filename="upload-codecov.yml"}
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@692973e3d937129bcbf40652eb9f2f61becf3332 # sha for v4.1.7
- uses: codecov/codecov-action@af2ee03a4e3e11499d866845a1e6c5a11f85cf4e # sha v4.5.0 
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }} # required
```

## Background

* Open source projects have been subject to a number of
[social engineering attacks][openjs] recently. 
* This [blog post][julienrenaux] describes risk in relying on GitHub Actions
written by others.

## The Risk in Plain English

1. Developers use [GitHub Actions][marketplace] to conveniently automate
various tasks. These Actions are often written and maintained by helpful
members of the open-source community.
2. Some of these Actions require access to secret credentials, for example to
publish code to services in the cloud.
3. Many of these Actions are widely adopted in the open source community,
handling thousands of secrets every day. Developers consider the wide adoption
of an Action when deciding whether to trust it.
4. There is a risk that bad actors could gain access to an Action's code
by placing pressure upon the package maintainers.
5. Once a bad actor has access to this code, they are able to adjust the code
associated with the version reference, to do something nefarious, such as
harvest secret credentials.
6. Updating workflow files to reference the Actions by commit hash guarantees
that this code can be trusted to 'do what it says on the tin' in the future.
Bad actors are unable to create new code that has the same commit reference
code (known as SHA, short for Simple Hashing Algorithm).

## Updating Your Workflow Files

:::{.callout-caution}

The layout of the GitHub user interface is liable to change.

:::

1. Find the Action that you wish to use on GitHub and click on its banner to
navigate to the Action's homepage.

2. Ensure that you have identified the correct Action by checking the author
and the number of stars. Click on the link shown to navigate to the Action's
repository.

![The Codecov Action homepage](/./www/14-gh-actions-security/02.webp)

3. Consult the readme and releases section to identify the latest version of
the Action. Ensure that the appropriate branch is selected from the branch
selector widget.

4. Once you have selected the appropriate branch for the latest release, click
on the commits section.

![Click on the commits](/./www/14-gh-actions-security/04.webp)

5. From the list of commits, select the commit associated with the latest
release and click the copy button to copy the full commit SHA reference to your
clipboard.

6. Replace the version reference in your workflow file with your copied commit
reference. 

## Likelihood and Severity

The likelihood of this risk is debatable, but it is not zero.

The community of developers would likely pick up on such an event quickly and
many of the targeted Action's users would benefit from this awareness before
any damage could be wrought. But why would you roll the dice? It may be equally
possible that you and your colleagues may not realise this event has occurred
before it was too late to intervene. 

The severity of such an event would relate to the nature of the targeted
Action. If said Action intercepted cloud service credentials, such as those
required for deployment to GCP, AWS and the like, then the severity could
be high. Whereas targeting widely used Actions such as the
[checkout Action][checkout] would present differing severities for public or
private repositories that use it.

As the effort needed to mitigate this risk is very small, I would encourage
GitHub Actions users to consider updating all repositories that make use of
such Actions for their continuous deployment workflows. In support of this
suggested mitigation, here you can see that the well-known python package
[`numpy`][numpy] have adopted this approach.
