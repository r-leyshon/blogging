## Unleashing Your Inner Space Scavenger

It's been a while since I've dedicated to a Bethesda video game. The last would
have been Fallout 3 in 2009-ish. Since then a lot has changed for me. Kids, a
job in data science and a lot less time to absorb myself in RPGs. But with the
hype around Bethesda's Starfield, I once again find myself creeping abandoned
outposts, stealing junk. This time, in space rather than a post-apocalyptic
alternative Earth.

Embarking on a galactic scavenger hunt in the realms of Bethesda's Starfield is
akin to being a spacefaring treasure hunter. Imagine prowling through forsaken
outposts, seeking riches beyond measure amidst the cosmos. The challenge,
however, lies in discerning the true gems from the cosmic clutter.

In this whirlwind of interstellar looting, the pivotal question arises: What
celestial junk is truly worth hoarding in this game?

{{< fa piggy-bank title="a piggybank" >}} Aiming to hoard everything may seem
like a stellar strategy, but alas, even the boundless void of space has its
limits. An excess of loot can weigh you down, impeding your maneuvers through
the cosmos. To strike the perfect balance, we need to delve deeper, beyond just
mass and value. We need to calculate the ratio of these two values, unveiling
the true worth of each celestial find.

Calculating the credit per gram ratio unlocks the secrets to discerning the
relative value of all available items.

## Unveiling the Cosmic Equation

Join me as we venture into the depths of Starfield's resource catalogue. We'll
decipher the mysteries of mass, value, and rarity to pinpoint the celestial
treasures worth their weight in gold—or rather, in galactic credits.

### Gathering Data in the Digital Cosmos

To navigate this cosmic quest, we turn to the wealth of information readily
available on Starfield's resources. Numerous websites offer tables detailing
these cosmic artifacts. For this article, I selected 
<https://inara.cz/starfield/database/>, a site that helpfully separates the
various Starfield collectibles into meaningful categories.

For those curious about the code behind the scenes,
[check it out on GitHub <i class="fa-brands fa-github fa-shake fa-lg" style="color: #030303;"></i>](https://github.com/r-leyshon/munge-starfield/blob/main/viz-resources.ipynb)
(GitHub account required).

## The Cosmic Riches: Mass, Value, and Rarity

Below, I plot the available resources' masses and values, colouring by rarity.
An ordinary least squares (OLS) trend line across all item rarities has been
plotted in white. This is the line of best fit that minimises the residuals -
the differences between the observed values and trend line.

What does the line mean for selecting resources to loot? Any point above that
line is worth collecting. Anything below that line would probably be worth
ditching if something higher in value or lower in mass became available. Hover
over the points to get the resource names.

Note that several resources with zero value and mass were removed from the
data during processing. I'm generally not interested in things without mass
as they pose no dilemma to my encumbered pockets.

### Insights from the Celestial Scatter

Here's what we've discovered:

* Rare and exotic items offer around average payoff.
* Two standouts, Caelumite and Quark-Degenerate Tissues, are definitely worth
collecting.
* Exotic and Unique resources tend to be low mass, all being under 3 grams.
* Most uncommon resources don't offer substantial returns, except for select
options like Helium, Silver, and Benzene. These are the lower mass options in
this rarity class.
* Vac Grade Explosives, a common item, stands out as a valuable choice.
* The rare class of resources generally promises better returns, with notable
outliers like Veryl Explosive and Vytinium Fuel Rod.

As I have no data on the different likelihoods of discovering these items
(rarity drop rates), I cannot comment on which items are best to target for
farming. Though <https://inara.cz/starfield/database/> does offer in-game
locations where these resources may be found.

## Value Per Gram: The Cosmic Currency

Let's break down the data further, showcasing each resource's value-to-mass
ratio, measured in credits per gram. Unveil the best options to fill your
cosmic coffers.

## Value Per Gram

Below I present the data for each resource in tabular format. The `ratio`
column means value / mass, in credits per gram. The resources are sorted by
descending ratio by default, but you can change that by clicking on the arrows
in each column.

</div>

### Key Takeaways

* Caelumite and Quark-Degenerate Tissues are high outliers, reaffirming their
status as top choices.
* Surprisingly, Vac Grade Explosive emerges as a standout, despite being
categorized as common.

Fill your boots up with Vac Grade Explosive. Though think about taking out good
life insurance, first.
:::

Sorting the ratio column in ascending order reveals the poor choices of
resources to collect. At least in terms of value per gram. Fiber, Water,
Nutrient, all of these things sound so wholesome. Perhaps there are alternative
reasons for hoarding such items, such as crafting or survival. It's not all
about becoming the richest spaceperson in the universe, right?
<i class="fa-solid fa-user-astronaut fa-fade fa-lg"></i>

By plotting the density of value to mass ratio for each rarity class, an
interesting picture emerges. For this chart, I have filtered out those 2
high-end unique outliers, otherwise the traces are a bit small and hard to see.

### Some observations

* Exotic and Unique rarities show a bimodal distribution (2 peaks in value to
mass ratio).
* The other rarities exhibit trimodal distributions. 
* Common and Rare classes have a clear outlier (Vac Grade Explosive and Veryl
Explosive). This game places a high value on blowing things up.
* Rare resources display a wider distribution in value per gram, making it a
good compromise in availability, mass and value.
