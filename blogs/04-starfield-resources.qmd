## An OCD for Looting

It's been a while since I've dedicated to a Bethesda video game. The last would
have been Fallout 3 in 2009-ish. Since then a lot has changed for me. Kids, a
job in data science and a lot less time to absorb myself in RPGs. But with the
hype around Bethesda's Starfield, I once again find myself creeping abandoned
outposts, stealing junk. This time, in space rather than a post-apocalyptic
alternative Earth.

While living out my unexplored kleptomania in Starfield, one thing has left me 
pondering. Just what junk is **worth** looting in this game?
{{< fa piggy-bank title="a piggybank" >}} Grabbing everything quickly leads to
an encumbered state (damn the developers), quickly penalising my rampant
hoarding efforts with an inability to run or jump. So with my approach to
looting tempered by a finite ability to carry it all, I don't just need to know
the mass and value of the items, I need to know the  ratio of those 2 values.

:::{.callout-note}
A credit per gram ratio would allow comparison of the relative worth of all
items available. 
:::

Luckily, several websites publish tables of resources discovered within
Starfield. To get the data I needed to produce the visualisations in this
article, I chose to webscrape the data from
<https://inara.cz/starfield/database/>, as the site is permissive to
webcrawling and the structure of the tables are friendly to work with. While
this site contains data on over 100 Starfield resources, it does not claim to
be exhaustive. Please bear in mind that other databases may vary in content.

If you're interested in the python code used to scrape the data, thats
available [on GitHub <i class="fa-brands fa-github fa-shake fa-lg" style="color: #030303;"></i>](https://github.com/r-leyshon/munge-starfield). 

## Mass, Value & Rarity

Below, I plot the available resources' masses and values, colouring by rarity.
An ordinary least squares (OLS) trend line across all item rarities has been
plotted in white. This is the line of best fit that minimises the residuals -
the differences between the observed values and trend line.

What does the line mean for selecting resources to loot? Any point above that
line is worth collecting. Anything below that line would probably be worth
ditching if something higher in value or lower in mass became available. Hover
over the points to get the resource names.

Note that several resources with zero value and mass were removed from the
data during processing. I'm generally not interested in things without mass
as they pose no dilemma to my encumbered pockets.

</div>

Some observations:

* Rare and exotics tend to be around average payoff.
* 2 Notable exceptions for unique items are Caelumite and Quark-Degenerate
Tissues - grab these!
* Exotic and Unique resources tend to be low mass, all being under 3 grams.
* Most uncommon resources do not offer good returns, apart from Helium, Silver
and Benzene, the lower mass options for this rarity.
* Common items fare similarly, apart from Vac Grade Explosives which are worth
grabbing.
* The rare class of resources tends to offer better returns with some notable
outliers being Veryl Explosive and Vytinium Fuel Rod.

As I have no data on the different likelihoods of discovering these items
(rarity drop rates), I cannot comment on which items are best to target for
farming. Though <https://inara.cz/starfield/database/> does offer in game
locations where these resources may be found.

## Value Per Gram

Below I present the data for each resource in tabular format. The `ratio`
column means value / mass, in credits per gram. The resources are sorted by
descending ratio by default, but you can change that by clicking on the arrows
in each column.

<div class=centerdiv height=800px>
  <iframe src="https://r-leyshon.github.io/munge-starfield/table.html" style="height: 650px; border: none" class=shaded_box></iframe>
</div>

Caelumite and Quark-Degenerate Tissues are clear high outliers, again
reinforcing their choice for the more discerning Starfield looters.
Interestingly, Vac Grade Explosive pips Vytinium Fuel Rod to fourth best option
in terms of credits per gram. Which is pretty remarkable since it's categorised
as a common resource.

:::{.callout-note}
Fill your boots up with Vac Grade Explosive. Though think about taking out good
life insurance, first.
:::

Sorting the ratio column in ascending order reveals the poor choices of
resources to collect. At least in terms of value per grams. Fiber, Water,
Nutrient, all of these things sound so wholesome. Perhaps there are alternative
reasons for hoarding such items, such as crafting or survival. It's not all
about becoming the richest spaceperson in the universe, right?
<i class="fa-solid fa-user-astronaut fa-fade fa-lg"></i>

By plotting the density of value to mass ratio for each rarity class, an
interesting picture emerges. Just be sure to filter out those 2 high-end unique
outliers first, else you get very small traces.

Some observations:

* Exotic and Unique rarities show a bimodal distribution (2 peaks in value to
mass ratio).
* The other rarities exhibit trimodal distributions. 
* Common and Rare classes have a clear outlier (Vac Grade Explosive and Veryl
Explosive). This game places a high value on blowing things up.
* Rare resources display a wider distribution in value per gram, making it a
good compromise in availability, mass and value.

## In Summary

By using some pretty basic python code, it's possible to scrape web content to
get at some pretty insightful data for making fundamental life choices, such as
which virtual resources to greedily hoard and pawn for fictitious returns
during your leisure time.

The value per gram ratio reveals which items are worth targetting, along with
a potentially subconscious predeliction to explosives and a distaste for
wholesome items within the Starfield developer team. Sending them coffee and
hugs - it's been a great game so far! <i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot fa-lg"></i>
