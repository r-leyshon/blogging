# Notepad Section Maintenance Guide

## Overview
The Notepad is a deliberately scruffy, low-friction space for quick ideas, experiments, and snippets. It follows a "digital garden" philosophy—content can be rough, incomplete, and evolve over time.

## Adding New Notes

### 1. Create the article file
```bash
# In notepad/ directory, create a new .qmd file
touch notepad/XX-slug-name.qmd
```

### 2. Required YAML frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: "Your Note Title"
description: "Brief one-liner description"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [category1, category2]
body-classes: notepad-section
image: /./www/notepad/XX-slug-name.jpg
image-alt: "Descriptive alt text"
---
```

### 3. Add hero image (optional but recommended)
After the YAML frontmatter, use the cozy polaroid-style wrapper:
```html
<div class="notepad-hero">
<img src=/./www/notepad/XX-slug-name.jpg alt="Alt text">
</div>
```
This creates a polaroid-style image with:
- Cream paper frame with extra space at bottom
- Subtle tape effect at top
- Slight rotation for a casual, pinned-to-board feel
- Hover animation that straightens the image

### 4. To pin an article to the top
Add `order: 1` to the YAML frontmatter (lower numbers appear first).

## Image Guidelines

### Style direction
- **Aesthetic**: Lofi, cozy, sketchbook/doodle style
- **NOT**: Cyberpunk (that's for the main blogs)
- Good subjects: Cozy desk scenes, notebook sketches, warm lighting, coffee, analog feel

### Optimization (REQUIRED before commit)
```bash
# Convert PNG to optimized JPG
cd www/notepad
sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 80 "filename.png" --out "filename.jpg"
rm filename.png
```
Target: Keep images under 400KB.

## The Spirit of the Notepad

### What belongs here
- ✅ Quick tips and TILs (Today I Learned)
- ✅ Rough ideas and half-formed thoughts
- ✅ Code snippets worth remembering
- ✅ Experiments and explorations
- ✅ Things that might grow into full articles later
- ✅ Personal notes that might help others

### What doesn't belong
- ❌ Polished tutorials (those go in Technical Blog)
- ❌ Long-form content requiring extensive editing
- ❌ Anything requiring extensive research/citations

### Writing style
- Keep it brief and casual
- Imperfection is acceptable—even encouraged
- First-person voice is fine
- No need for extensive structure or headers
- Link to fuller resources if they exist

### Digital garden principles
1. **Tend, don't publish**: Notes can be updated, pruned, or expanded over time
2. **Bi-directional thinking**: Link between notes when relevant
3. **Show your work**: Rough ideas are valuable
4. **Low friction**: If adding a note feels like work, simplify

## File Locations
- Articles: `notepad/*.qmd`
- Images: `www/notepad/*.jpg`
- Index config: `notepad/index.qmd`
- Styling: `www/styles.css` (search for `.notepad-section`)

## Styling Notes
- Cards use handwritten font (Caveat)
- Cream/beige paper background with lined texture
- Spiral binding holes on left edge
- Torn paper edge at bottom
- Dark mode supported (switches to darker paper tones)

## Categories
Keep categories informal and descriptive:
- `meta` - About the notepad itself
- `til` - Today I Learned
- `snippet` - Code snippets
- `idea` - Half-formed thoughts
- `experiment` - Things being tried out
