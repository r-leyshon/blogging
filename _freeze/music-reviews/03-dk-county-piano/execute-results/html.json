I recall when a\nchildhood friend of mine had received it as an Easter present. The graphics\nwere mind blowing, the 2 player couch coop highly addictive, and the audio\ncertainly made an impression that lasted longer than I had realised. At the\ntime I recall I hadn't made the transition to the 16-bit generation, and in\ncomparison to my decidedly lacklustre Master System, this looked like the\nfuture of video gaming.\n\nThirty years later, I asked Alexa to play some soothing dog music for the\ndaschsunds while I did the school run - like most dachsunds, they're the\nanxious type. As I returned to start work, my nostalgia radar was piqued as a\nbeautiful reimagining of Aquatic Ambience sweetly serenaded the pups. That was\nmy serendipitous introduction to this little melancholy gem.\n\n\n<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3L6hd0cFppOmzmpd8DAgF8?utm_source=generator&theme=0\n\" width=\"40%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" class=center></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\n\nFor a formal description of the audio feature categories presented here, please\nconsult the\n<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Developer API Documentation</a>.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" width='300px'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-dk-county-piano_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Interpreting the Ridge Plot (Click to expand)\n\nThese ridge plots show a histogram of the mean audio feature values across each\ntrack in the album. Look across the horizontal axis at where the peaks for each\nfeature occur. For example, if the album contains lots of tracks with busy\nvocals, the speechiness feature will show a peak to the right of the horizontal\naxis. Conversely, an instrumental album would have a speechiness peak to the\nleft of the horizontal axis but you would also expect it to have a peak to the\nright of the axis in the instrumentalness feature.\n:::\n\nAs the album is so short, we see some very tight distributions here and no\nsurprises this time, apart from a middling danceability (ballet perhaps?). All\ntracks are very high in instrumentalness and acousticness. The album is very\nlow in speechiness as you'd expect. Energy is low throughout. Even where the\nsource material is decidedly spritely, it is played here in a soft and\nponderous tempo. A slightly broader distribution in valence and danceability\ncan be observed.\n\nPut this album on when you need to pick through failing code. It will encourage\nalpha brain waves and keep you from switching context to something less\nproblematic.\n\n\n## The Tracks\n\nBelow are the mean audio feature values for each track.

Island Swing, Simian Segue and Gang-Plank Galleon drag the mean\nvalence of the album up, while in terms of danceability, Gang-Plank-Galleon is\na relative toe tapper.\n\n\n**Island Swing**\n\nStarts with a gorgeous, plaintiff melody, turning to the distinctive\nsaloon-inspired hook that clearly identifies the original game. This track\npauses for new material at points so much that I felt it must be a medley.\nHowever on  reprising the original audio, it does pay a faithful tribute to the\noriginal. It finishes as sweetly as it started and sets the scene well for\nwhats to be expected.\n\n**Forest Frenzy**\n\nA deeply ponderous cadence interspersed by moments of treble clarity played so\nsoftly. The artist really has tempered the frenzy in this forest very well.\nWhat remains is a lullaby.\n\n**Aquatic Ambience**\n\nThis track absolutely steals the show. In all fairness the original was genius,\nbut this is such an exquisite rendition. The movements are played very freely,\nsoftening the tighter tempo of the original. This is the track not to miss.\n\n**Simian Segue**\n\nThis is the track from the level select map. The valence rises a fair bit here,\nwhich is very understandable considering this must be the most recognisable\nhook from the game. It's still a bit playful, even when softly played with\nsome powerful major chord shifts making this a decidedly cheery affair.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Donkey-Kong-Country08242023-102816-26133.jpg\" style=\"display: block; width: 50%; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" alt=\"Donkey Kong Country level select https://www.gameuidatabase.com/\">\n\n**Gang-Plank Galleon**\n\nAh, I have no recollection of this track. It must be owing to the fact that\nthis was the music for the final boss of the game. I was clearly not good\nenough to make it this far as a kid. The song begins as its title would suggest\nwith a decidedly swashbuckling theme. This soon recedes, handing the limelight\nto a beautiful melancholy solo that sounds like a distinct song. Once more,\nreprising the original, its clear that this is a pretty faithful reprise of the\nsoundtrack that came with the game.\n\n## Overall\n\nWhether or not 1990s Nintendo is your thing, what a beautiful effort from the\nartist. I'd recommend listening to their other albums in a similar vein. But\nthis one is my favourite. I am likely biased due to some formative connection\nto the source material. But whether serenity is your goal, or maybe you just\nneed to get a baby off to sleep, this little album is the right tool for the\njob.\n\nFor more music to encourage your work efforts, check out\n[Productivity Pulse](index.qmd).\n",
