It's aged particularly well on the latest generation of consoles, thanks\nin no small part to its fantastic soundtrack. The developers made a safe bet\nin selecting Daniel Deluxe to compose the nihilistic, cyberpunk soundtrack.\nDeluxe has been producing knockout darksynth since 2014 and has been a regular\nfeature of my working music since I started programming.\n\nDeluxe's 2014 effort by the name of\n[Darkness](https://open.spotify.com/album/1G66EjFlNMcXL4sudDiYEF) was one of\nthe first synthwave songs I had come across and partly the reason why I have\ngone so deep with this genre. It's a fantastic piece of 80s romantic nostalgia\nwith evocative speech samples taken from the 1985 fantasy movie Legend,\nstarring Tim Curry as the eponymous Darkness - a character that haunted the\nnightmares of many '80s children. Much of Deluxe's catalogue is worthy of your\ntime and Ghostrunner OST is the crowning achievement. As his fifth and\nlatest (at time of writing) studio album, Ghostrunner draws and builds upon the\nstylistic themes explored in previous albums. Though in this effort, a shorter\naverage track length has kept things laser-focussed. Ghostrunner is a great\nintroduction to synthwave of the catalogue of Daniel Deluxe as a whole, but\nluckily for the newcomer - there's plenty of depth to mine from this musical\nvein.\n\n## Music for Cyborg Ninjas\n\nIt's worth noting that this music isn't for everyone. But I've never favoured\nthat sort of music myself and wouldn't find the time to review it. This music\nwas written to energise players ready to engage in parkour-slash-em-up fun,\nwithout distracting from the brief interludes of narrative. As with\nall my favoured music for work, you won't find any ballads or warbling\nvocals here, so if you want something to hum along to, you'd best find\nanother blog!\n\nBut if you're down for this, I'd recommend clicking play on the spotify player\nbutton and enjoying the tunes while you read.\n\n<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6mS0ssCxtLvB0IcVP7sR66?utm_source=generator\" width=\"40%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" class=center></iframe>\n<br>\nLet's take a look at the audio feature analysis for this album. For a formal\ndescription of the audio feature categories presented here, please consult the\n<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Developer API Documentation</a>.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" width='300px'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-ghostrunner-ost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Interpreting the Ridge Plot (Click to expand)\n\nThese ridge plots show a histogram of the mean audio feature values across each\ntrack in the album. Look across the horizontal axis at where the peaks for each\nfeature occur. For example, if the album contains lots of tracks with busy\nvocals, the speechiness feature will show a peak to the right of the horizontal\naxis. Conversely, an instrumental album would have a speechiness peak to the\nleft of the horizontal axis but you would also expect it to have a peak to the\nright of the axis in the instrumentalness feature.\n:::\n\nGhostrunner OST is clearly an instrumental album. This plot shows that the\ntracks all score lowly on speechiness and highly on instrumentalness, with\ntight distributions. The album generally displays high measures for energy and\ndanceability, though with broader distributions than that displayed by\nspeechiness & instrumentalness. The majority of the album is clear, steady and\nfast rhythm. Interestingly, the acousticness feature presents a very broad\nrange of distribution in the confidence that tracks do not have electrical\namplification. This really does not seem correct to me, as the album is\nunapologetically synth all the way. This is potentially affected by production\neffects favouring reverb and echo, but that is surmising on my part. Lastly,\nI'll turn to valence, which is a measure of positivity within the music. This\nfeature is right-skewed. A higher number of lower valence values makes sense,\nas much of the album carries a sinister, Orwellian, digital-dystopian tone -\ngenerally interpretable as negative I would agree. The presence of higher\nvalues in this feature suggests that a fewer number of the tracks may be\ncharacterised with positive emotion.\n\n## The Tracks\n\nBelow are the mean audio feature values for each track. The last row (green)\npresents a mean summary of the album.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> track_name </th>\n

A mashy\nbass beat rounds out this atmospheric ode to a mysterious, futuristic\ncityscape.\n\n**Infiltrator**\nBassy experiments with tempo against a stripped-back rhythm section. Reminds me\nof scrap brain zone on sonic the hedgehog. Intermittent alert signals and\nrobotic glitches. Glimpses of some wonderful serene motif before being thrust\nback into the main formation. At the time of writing, this track is currently\nthe most popular on this album.\n\n**Blood and steel**\nThis track is very recognizable. Inspires an unsettling feeling of Deja vú\nwithin the listener. Conjuring images of a futuristic crime scene\ninvestigation. A dreamy intro before a strong drum & bass injection. The\ntrack culminates in a growing phaser storm that smothers the rest of the track\nbefore it cuts at the point of its culmination. A highlight of the album.\n\n**Dharma**\nAnyone of a certain age will likely remember ABC's gripping sci fi\nthriller Lost, of the early noughties. Dharma was the name of the malevolent. corporation behind much of the protagonists woes. This track strikes a fittingly menacing\ntone. A dripping, ticking lick loops over a bossy bass hook. Lazer phasers\ngrowing in tone & pitch throughout for good measure.\n\n**Capture**\nA zoned out, decidedly creepy intro with an android snigger looped over bell\ntolls, metallic pipes clanging and a menagerie of industrial noise. A slower\nbeat chugging away only to take frequent breaks to peak at you from the\nshadows. Sinister but with style.\n\n**Forget the past**\nBegins on a melancholy reflection that seems to consider the song's title some\nadvice to self. Continues the chilling set by the previous track with an\ninhumane battery of bass noise, giving way to serene, elongated spacetrips of\nharmonic synth.\n\n**Access denied**\nA collective of error signals experienced through a thick gelatinous membrane.\nThis song feels like being rudely awoken from the matrix. An electric wire to\nthe brain in the high tempo intro of a squelchy phaser bleep on loop. Drum &\ncymbal snares introduce some peril to the experience. Another favourite of\nmine.\n\n**Let them know**\nHigh pitch melodic trills over a stripped back drum beat with a growing,\nbubbling, frothy arsenal of phaser barrages. The trills give way to a strong\nbass line, dipping in and out of the foreground. Halfway in, a Wipeout-style\nhigh speed fade is accompanied by checkpoint ticks that sound a bit like\nhitting metal on metal. This track has a great time trial feel. The layers\nwipe together in a busy, well-structured crescendo. This is the highlight of\nthe album for me.\n\n**Sector**\nStarting on a mysterious, hyper-speed contrail of sound. With some\nproductionised robot intonation rapping over the crunchy bass drum. Joined\nlater by a Japanese-inspired treble section for the interested Japanophile.\nReminiscent of the excellent\n[Triads by Code Elektro](https://open.spotify.com/album/3K48lplYXbQSc87pfuJ0Pa)\n(review sure to come at some point).\n\n**Factory**\nA clever mix of major and minor android aria signals. Locking in some bassy\nrobo groans with some mysterious echo-flared laser trills. The track descends\ninto a mission impossible repeato while adding some beautiful high frequency\nsynth melody.\n\n**Striker**\nEnters with an industrial explosion experienced from a vast distance, rippling\nout into a wide pool of synth integration tests, like circuit fingers working\nthrough a mossy undertow. High frequency synth chimes with a glitched notation\nslips away to a seedy, menacing robotic bridge. The pretty synth\nreturns to work over the menacing robo. A close second favourite.\n\n**Celerity** - Celerity is not a word I have encountered before, but according\nto [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/celerity) it means swift\nmovement. An interesting choice of title for this track as I interpret the\nrhythm to be more steady.\nStarting on a\n[Prodigy-like industrial D&B](https://open.spotify.com/track/3xH7xicTlukrmnHIHINTW0)\nreplete with an accompanying fairground loop. A glitched-up affair with a\njarring, chugging interference playing with your expectations throughout. This\nmoves on to some graceful tech wipes for a moment before the interference\ndominates once more. Ending on a commandeering double-time march to up the\nante, this track conjures a long-distance robotic pursuit.\n\n**The orb**\nAt this point in the album, we encounter a run of shorter, more intense songs.\nThe orb has a brilliant, shimmering, robot talk phasing in and out of\nconsciousness. Moving on to experiment with beat and tone patterns, swaying in\nand out of the fore as the beat establishes command. Short, but oh, so sweet.\n\n**Truth to power**\nA chunky drum section overlayed by a whispered android complaint growing\nto take full form, before relegated to radio playback. The android voice\njumps in and out of focus while comets wipe by and leaves a trail of icy debris\nzooming past the listener. Likely to be the sort of music that Chat-GPT\ngenerates when frustrated by the lack of imagination presented by its users.\n\n**Blaster**\nWatch out for this one - there's something larger rising out of the depths,\nwaving away in front of your ears. Once surfaced, it reveals itself to be\nlargely drum-engined automation with a bassy tempest of brass billowing away\nunder the surface, like an automaton that's managed to preserve the very last\nof the human tuba instrumentalists, lifespan extended with cybernetic implants.\n\n**Razor**\nAccusatory synth calls out against a halloween-esque synth sustain. Emerging\nout onto an '80s horror set before adopting an attention-demanding rhythm.\nHigh-end synth parrots away while some os-level tech blurb ramps up to the\nfore.\n\n**Vendetta**\nA reliable, robotic trill dances between pitches, laying off for some\nharmonious electro organ to swing in and out overhead. Machine gun volleys\nshower their weight to the beat.\n\n**Air (Cybervoid)**\nA welcome reprise to the first track of the album revisits a suspicious first\nday in a cybernetic future. A subtle difference to the original but more\nimmediate. Blazing and warm bass tones intervene the laser hook and encompasses\naround the track as it progresses.\n\n**Solitude**\nA dreamy space-age synthetic Bach rises from the murky depths to sit in a\nshimmering orchestral pool, composing his techno-symphonies. In stark contrast,\nsquishy, rubbery deep bass android vocals sound out over the alien morass.\n\n**Sundown**\nA gothic android monk prayer cedes to laser piano overlays. Cutting out to\nflatlined electro strings & the futuristic remnants of whatever birds evolved\ninto once AI conquered the Earth. A contemplative end to a high-energy album.\nLikely to reflect a sombre tone to the end of the video game, though I\ncannot confirm this as I was pretty rubbish when I tried it.\n\n## Highs and Lows\n\nNo real lows to talk of in this album, but the three standout tracks that I\nrecommend are:\n\n1. Let them know\n2. Striker\n3. Blood and steel\n\n## Overall\n\nA smashing piece of dark synthpop that delivers focussed energy while\nconserving your concentration. The theme is sinister at points but never loses\nits potency for concentrainment. A good choice for smashing out some shallow\nwork or a briefing note in a short space of time. Perhaps not as inspiring or\nuplifting as some of my other instrumental ambient choices for creative energy.\nBut this album establishes a steady cadence and will keep your foot tapping\nwhile your hands do the typing.",
