It's aged particularly well on the latest generation of consoles, thanks\nin no small part to its fantastic soundtrack. The developers made a safe bet\nin selecting Daniel Deluxe to compose the nihilistic, cyberpunk soundtrack.\nDeluxe has been producing knockout darksynth since 2014 and has been a regular\nfeature of my working music since I started programming. \n\nDeluxe's 2014 effort by the name of\n[Darkness](https://open.spotify.com/album/1G66EjFlNMcXL4sudDiYEF) was one of\nthe first synthwave songs I had come across and partly the reason why I have\ngone so deep with this genre. It's a fantastic piece of 80s romantic nostalgia\nwith evocative speech samples taken from the 1985 fantasy movie Legend,\nstarring Tim Curry as the eponymous Darkness - a character that haunted the\nnightmares of many '80s children. Much of Deluxe's catalogue is worthy of your\ntime and Ghostrunner OST is possibly the crowning achievement. As his fifth and\nlatest (at time of writing) studio album, Ghostrunner draws and builds upon the\nstylistic themes explored in previous albums. Though in this effort, a shorter\naverage track length has kept things laser-focussed. Ghostrunner is a great\nintroduction to synthwave of the catalogue of Daniel Deluxe as a whole, but\nluckily for the newcomer - there's plenty of depth to mine from this musical\nvein.\n\n## Music for Cyborg Ninjas\n\nIt's worth noting that this music isn't for everyone. But I've never favoured\nthat sort of music myself and wouldn't find the time to review it. This music\nwas written to energise players ready to engage in parkour-slash-em-up fun, \nwithout distracting from the brief interludes of narrative. As with\nall of my favoured music for work, you won't find any ballads or warbling\nvocals here, so if you wan't something to humm along to, you'd best find\nanother blog!\n\nBut if you're down for this, I'd recommend clicking play on the spotify player\nbutton and enjoying the tunes while you read.\n\n<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6mS0ssCxtLvB0IcVP7sR66?utm_source=generator\" width=\"40%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" class=center></iframe>\n<br>\nLet's take a look at the audio feature analysis for this album. For a formal\ndescription of the audio feature categories presented here, please consult the \n<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Developer API Documentation</a>.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" width='300px'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-ghostrunner-ost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Interpreting the Ridge Plot (Click to expand)\n\nThese ridge plots show a histogram of the mean audio feature values across each track in the album. Look across the horizontal axis at where the peaks for each feature occur. For eample, if the album contains lots of tracks with busy vocals, the speechiness feature will show a peak to the right of the horizontal axis. Conversely, an instrumental album would have a speechiness peak to the left of the horizontal axis but you would also expect it to have a peak to the right of the axis in the instrumentalness feature.\n:::\n\nGhostrunner OST is clearly an instrumental album. This plot show that the tracks all score lowly on speechiness and highly on instrumentalness, with tight distributions. The album generally displays high measures for energy and danceability, though with broader distributions than that displayed by speechiness & instrumentalness. The majority of the album is characterised by clear, steady and fast rhythm. Interestingly, the acousticness feature presents a very broad range of distribution in the confidence that tracks do not have electrical amplification. This really does not seem correct to me, as the album is unapologetically synth all the way. This has potentially been affected by production effects favouring reverb and echo, but that is surmising on my part. Lastly, I'll turn to valence, which is a measure of positivity within the music. This feature is left-skewed. A higher number of lower valence values makes sense, as much of the album carries a sinister, Orwellian, digital-dystopian tone - generally interpretable as negative I would agree. The presence of higher values in this feature suggests that a fewer number of the tracks may be characterised with positive emotion. \n\n## The Tracks\n\nBelow are the mean audio feature values for each track.

- beautiful synth bleeps with menacing robot groans, mashy bass & steady beat. Atmpsjperic, mysterious, full futuristic cityscape.\n\n\n**Infiltrator** - Bassy play around with tempo, stripped back, reminds me of scrap brain zone on sonic the hedgehog. Alert noises and robot glitches. Glimpses of some wonderful serene motif before being thrust back into the beat formation.\n\n**Blood and steel** - very recognisable. De ja vu. Futuristic detective investigating crime scene. Lovely dreamy intro prior to strong d&B injection. Phaser injection that grows and drowns out track before cutting out.\n\n**Dharma** - reminds of Lost? Much more menacing. Dripping, ticking lick over a bossy D&B hook. Lazer phasers growing in tone & pitch throughout. \n\n**Capture** - zoned out, creepy intro with a robot snigger looped over creepy bell chime and pipe industrial noise. A slower beat, chugging away and taking frequent breaks to peak at you from the shadows.\n\n**Forget the past** - continues the theme with a chilling, inhumane  bass battery, giving way to spaced out, elongated spacetrips with harmonic synth. Very short.\n\n**Access denied** - error signals through a thick gelatinous membrane. Like being rudely awoken from the matrix. An electric wire to the brain in the high tempo intro of a squelchy phaser bleep on loop. Drum & cymbal snare introduces some ill-feeling time management. \n\n**Let them know** - higher range melodic expletives over a stripped back drum beat, and a growing, bubbling, frothy arsenal of phaser barrages. Giving way to a much stronger bass and dipping in and out with further volleys. Wipeout style high speed wipe and some time out ticks, sounds like hitting a spoon on a tin bowl. Robot timeout. Layers wiped together in a busy, structured crescendo.\n\n**Sector** - mysterious hyper speed contrail sound. With some product ionised robot intonation, rapping over the crunchy bass drum. Imagine you programmed a robot with the licence to low-fi rap. \n\n**Factory** - clever mix of major minor android aria signals. Locking in some bassy robo groans with some mysterious echo -flared laser trills. Descends into a mission impossible repeato added some beautiful high freq synth melody.\n\n**Striker** - enters with an industrial explosion experienced from a vast distance, echoing out into a wide pool of synth intergration tests, like circuit fingers working through a mossy undertow. High freq synth chimes with glitch notation slips away to a seedy, menacing robo bridge. The pretty synth returns to work over the menacing robo.\n\n**Celerity** - Prodigy-like industrial D&B with some Charlie always tells his mommy fairground loop. Being glitched out with a jarring, chugging interference. Giving way to some graceful tech wipes for a moment before the interference invades once more. Moving to a double time march to up the ante, long distance robo chase,.\n\n**The orb** - shimmering, robot talk phasing in and out of consciousness. Moves onto experiment with the beat and tone, swaying in and out of the fore as the beat establishes command. \n\n**Truth to power** - a whispered android complaint grows and takes full form, before being resigned to radio playback. Jumps in and out of the foreground while comets wipe by and leaves a trail of icy debris zooming past the listener. \n\n**Blaster** - something larger rising out of the depths, waving away in front of your ears. Once surfaced, reveals itself to be largely drum-driven automation with a bassy tempest of brass billowing away under the surface. \n\n**Razor** - accusatory synth calls against a halloween-esque synth sustain. Emerges onto an 80s horror set before adopting a atention-demanding rhythm section. High-end synth parrots away while some os-level tech blurb ramps up to the fore. \n\n**Vendetta** - reliable, robot trill dances between pitches, laying off for some harmonious electro organ to swing in and out overhead. While machine gun volleys show their weight to the beat.\n\n**Air** (Cybervoid) a welcome reprise to the first track revisits the suspicious first day in a cybernetic future. Blazing bass warmly intervenes the laser hook and meshes around as the track progresses. \n\n**Solitude** - dreamy space age synthetic  Bach - rises from the murky depths to sit in a shimmering orchestral pool while sum squishy, rubber deep bass robe vocals sound out over the morass. \n\n**Sundown** - gothic android monk prayer gives way to laser piano overlays. Cutting out to flatlined electro strings & the futuristic remnants of whatever birds evolved into once AI conquered the Earth. \n",
