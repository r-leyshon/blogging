In its fourth decade and\none of the most successful adventure series in video games, beloved for its\nsense of innovation each game has added a fresh interpretation of the Zelda\nuniverse to series. \n\nThe music of the games has often been at the core of establishing its identity.\nAt times, music has played a key construct in the games' development. The N64\nbatch of games adopted a core game mechanic where the ability to accurately\nplay songs on an instrument called an ocarina triggered key plot events such as\ntravelling through time. Perhaps due to this, many of the tracks here are from\nthis period of Zelda's history.\n\n\n## Songs for the Recovering Adventurers\n\nZelda & Chill is a love note to the iconic music produced by the Zelda\ndevelopers. As a casual fan, I have enjoyed many of the games in the series\nand the album manages to prod the nostalgia sensor in my brain even on multiple\nplaythroughs. But even for those disinterested in video games, this album is \ngreat for drowning out the outside world and establishing the focus needed for\n deep work. \n\n<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3oNO1P0Qlr4oSlMA2MIj67?utm_source=generator&theme=0\" width=\"40%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" class=center></iframe>\n<br>\nLet's take a look at the audio feature analysis for this album. For a formal\ndescription of the audio feature categories presented here, please consult the\n<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Developer API Documentation</a>.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" width='300px'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02-zelda-and-chill_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Interpreting the Ridge Plot (Click to expand)\n\nThese ridge plots show a histogram of the mean audio feature values across each\ntrack in the album. Look across the horizontal axis at where the peaks for each\nfeature occur. For example, if the album contains lots of tracks with busy\nvocals, the speechiness feature will show a peak to the right of the horizontal\naxis. Conversely, an instrumental album would have a speechiness peak to the\nleft of the horizontal axis but you would also expect it to have a peak to the\nright of the axis in the instrumentalness feature.\n:::\n\nI find it surprising that there is such a wide distribution in the valence of\nthe songs. I expected the album to be distributed centrally as the pace and\ntone of the music is generally understated. But there are a couple of tracks\nthat strike a more melancholy tone, such as Dark World and Gerudo Valley. At\nthe other end of the scale, the Legend of Zelda theme is likely the most\npositive on offer, so an even valence distribution perhaps makes sense. The\nalbum's speechiness and instrumentalness score as you'd expect. Danceability is\nnotably high, potentially as a result of the crunchy drum & bass lines present\nin all the songs. Acousticness is generally low throughout the tracks though\nwith a broad distribution that is potentially influenced by recurring use of\npiano and string sections. Perhaps the most interesting feature for this album\nis energy, which describes the album as distinctly middle-of-the-road in terms\nof intensity. As a chill album you'd likely expect a lower energy but the\nstring rhythm section likely lifts the distribution of this feature.\n\n\n## The Tracks\n\nBelow are the mean audio feature values for each track.

While the Fairy Fountain has offered sanctuary to any\ndaring adventurer donning the guise of Link throughout the entire Zelda series,\nthis music theme is synonymous with the N64's Ocarina of Time. This rendition\nis a wonderful, crunchy production over a stripped-back ragtime tempo. Warm\nfeelings of safe havens are immediately conjured from the outset, with that\niconic dreamy harp intro. A strong start and sets the mood for the majority of\nthe rest of the album.\n\n**Dark world**\n\nFor those Zelda fans who can identify with A Link to the Past, this track may\nhold more significance. I have not played that game and checking out the\noriginal track, I’d say this version seems like a marked improvement. There's a\nfascinating contrast in this song - the meaty bass forms the perfect foil to\nthe high pitch tubular bell-effect hook.\n\n**Lost Woods**\n\nAnother one for the Ocarina of Time fans. A slightly slower pace than the\noriginal, hence the \"Relax\" in the album title. There’s a curious reverb effect\nat play that sounds a bit like a harpsichord fed through a tin can. After\nlistening to quite a bit of lofi I am on board with this, but I could see that\nit may be an acquired taste for some. Against the light and airy melody, the\nlow-tech production works really well. \n\n**Song of Storms**\n\nFamiliar to this wishing to summon rain in Ocarina of Time, this laid back\nrendition is mixed with a loop of the cooking theme from Breath of the Wild,\nreplete with periodic pot whistles & cutlery clanking against china. The\ncreative flair on show as the looped Song of Storms theme builds to a modest\ncrescendo (it’s chill after all) makes this one of my album highlights. \n\n**Minuet of Forest**\n\nThis song was originally used in Ocarina of Time to warp characters back to the\nstart of the lost woods play area - one of the more challenging areas in the\nearly game. The artists have expertly built on what was a very brief movement\nin the original material, adding a bouncy low-end bass while keeping the track\nstructured with a snappy drum section. \n\n**Gerudo Valley**\n\nAnother Ocarina of Time offering here. The original Gerudo Valley theme was\nplayed on Spanish guitar in a flamenco-style with a high tempo. This rendition\n is nearly unrecognisable and undoubtedly brilliant. How the artist has\n isolated the key movements and set them against the slow, chuffing rhythm is\n quite amazing. The song is one of the more melancholy tunes and while lower in\n mood is undoubtedly beautiful.\n\n**Oath to Order**\n\nThis song originally appeared in Majora’s Mask and was used as a plot construct\nin that game - apparently to summon giants. I have little association with\nMajora’s Mask and having listened to it, I fail to identify the link to the\noriginal. Someone with a greater familiarity would potentially find more to\nidentify with. As a standalone piece, Oath to Order is a very warm-sounding,\nfuzzy sensation with a warbly theremin effect permeating throughout for a\nunique twist.\n\n**Dragon Roost Island**\n\nIt's great to have a theme from the Windwaker on the album, which in my opinion\nis one of the best Zelda games often overlooked for its cute exterior. The\noriginal track was distinctly latin with Spanish guitar, maracas & a forlorn\npanpipe high in the mix.  As in Gerudo Valley, the artists have slowed the pace\nwhile emphasising the main movement in the original source material. The\nguitars have been replaced with that warm fuzzy piano that permeates the entire\nalbum. \n\n**Kakariko Village**\n\nKakariko Village has made recurring appearances throughout the Zelda series of\ngames and I have struggled to identify which version of the series soundtracks\nthis song takes its inspiration from. Though the melody is very distinct and\nthe track is another of my album highlights. I presume it must be from one of\nthe games I am less familiar with. A light and plucky lick against a bright and\nbouncy bassline, there’s plenty to appreciate here.\n\n**Ballad of the Goddess**\n\nAnother recurring song in the later games within the Zelda series, I find it a\nvery enjoyable rendition despite my lack of familiarity with the source\nmaterial. The song seems to originate from Skyward Sword, building upon the\nmelody using sweet harp strings and later a dramatic orchestral accompaniment.\nIn this version, the artist has retained the harp in support of the main melody\nbut has worked with piano for the main melody. \n\n**Breath of the Wild**\n\nTaking its inspiration from the main theme of Breath of the Wild which perhaps\nlacks a distinctive identity in my opinion, this song starts with a promising\nloop of one of its more distinct movements. However, mid-way through the song\nit introduces some distinctly discordant keys that introduce a sort of\ndilapidated fairground motif to the song. This is one that I tend to skip for\nthose reasons - I find it hard to concentrate on my work with discordant sound\nin my ears. I view the track as an experiment and not in keeping with the rest\nof the album. \n\n**Hateno Village**\n\nAnother Breath of the Wild arrangement, Hateno Village is notably home to the\nAncient Tech Lab - an important site for acquiring gear upgrades as the game\nprogresses. In this rendition of the theme, the artists have retained some deep\nbass string although the main melody is now expertly played on piano. Again, I\nfeel that the original material is perhaps not the strongest on offer in this\nalbum while the reimagining on offer here is perhaps more interesting than the\nsource material.\n\n**Legend of Zelda**\n\nMaybe the most iconic video theme of all time. This mix pays homage to the\nseries’ 8-bit roots by experimenting with a chiptune style that does a great\njob of not getting skipped while I work - chiptune can be fun but not generally\nfor concentration. One of the more moving songs on offer, this track builds to\na crescendo replete with choral and piano arrangements, leaving the listener\nwith a distinct sense of grandeur capturing the scale of the video games. \n\n**Ocarina of Time**\n\nThe theme from the original N64 Zelda title is a fitting end to this fantastic\nhomage to perhaps one of the greatest video game adventure series. Kids of my\ngeneration will recall this iconic track as it accompanied the Ocarina of Time\nintro. The intro that blew the minds of a generation of Zelda fans who got to\nsee Link in 3D and on horseback in an amazing open world like never before.\nGreat times.\n\n## Highs and Lows\n\nBreath of the Wild is not to my taste and on writing this review, I suppose\nI've realised that I consider the soundtrack for this game to be somewhat\ninferior to the older games. No hate to Breath of the Wild, which is a\nmasterpiece in modern gaming, but perhaps the soundtrack is less of a focal\npoint and potentially appealing to a broader and more mature audience than the\nolder games in the series.\n\nStandout tracks to my mind are Song of Storms, Kakariko Village and Legend of\nZelda.\n\n## Overall\n\nThis album is a great choice for steadying the ship following a busy schedule.\nIt establishes quiet, focus and allows your brain's operating system to reboot\nfollowing a demanding presentation. I'd suggest this album as the first in a\nplaylist dedicated to carving out an afternoon of focus time. Set your status\nto 'do not disturb' and eliminate your to do list with the help of Link and his\nfriends.\n\nFor more music to encourage your work efforts, check out\n[Productivity Pulse](index.qmd).\n",
