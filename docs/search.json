In case that needs further qualification, this is the Python-native implementation of the beloved RShiny dashboarding package that has been available in the R programming framework for over a decade now. Python Shiny has benefited from the experience that the developers at Posit have gained in building its more mature, R-flavoured sibling.\nPython Shiny has experienced what I would describe as an accelerated evolution and has the potential to become a frontrunner in Pythonic, production-grade applications. Mainly because it adheres to an evaluation strategy which is a bit un-pythonic. Shiny introduces dashboarding with lazy evaluation, meaning that elements of your code will only be evaluated when there is a need to do so. This is not always a great idea, particularly for procedural or object-oriented programming. But it does make event-drive applications more efficient and scalable. More on Posit’s take on the USP of Python Shiny here."
