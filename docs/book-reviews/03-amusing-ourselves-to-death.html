<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>AOtD is a challenging read for a short book. It is heaped in cultural criticism and a pessimistic assessment of technological development that I would not recommend readilty internalising without thoughtful evaluation. However, much of the critique is well-reasoned and although written in the 1980s, is possibly of greater relevance today than when first penned.</p>
<section id="on-the-author" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-the-author">On the Author</h3>
<p>Neil Postman was a professor of communication at New York University. Well-known for his body of work in examining the study of knowledge-acquisition and pedagogy through the lens of societal decline. Postman endeavoured to influence public education curricula in the United States during his term as Chairman of the University’s Department for Culture and Communication.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="an-overview-of-the-book" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-overview-of-the-book">An Overview of the Book</h2>
<p>Postman’s critique is that the widespread adoption of television has subversively influenced culture, human behaviour and intellect in ways that could not be foreseen. Unaware of the broad repercussions of immersing ourselves in TV pop culture, the standards for entertainment in this medium of communication have permeated through society, from the boardroom to the classroom.</p>
<p>Postman warns that a culture; seemingly unaware of how trivial and distracted it has become; is at risk of losing its moral compass, leading to a state of shallow and low-value communication. The main premise of his warning is that rather than an Orwellian dystopian future where society is controlled by a despotic surveillance state, the dystopia that Postman predicts would be better characterised by Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. A future where a simpleton proletariat has been renderred ineffectual by the pursuit of hedonism at the cost of all else.</p>
<p>The book is organised into 2 parts and 11 chapters.</p>
<p>Part 1 achieves the scale of the apparent decline in literacy, logic and debate brought about by movement away from a largely print-based culture to one that celebrates moving pictures.</p>
<p>Part 2 argues that aspects of TV as a medium impose limitations on the length of exposition and the complexity of discourse that has widely influenced our lives. Postman exemplifies how this simplification of our public discourse has declined, with considerations from many important domains of modern culture.</p>
<section id="part-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-1">Part 1</h3>
<p>The book begins with a treatment of Huxley’s warning in a brave new world. A future in which civilisation is threatened by an over-supply of information and a reduction of the peoples’ ability to identify that which has meaning. Postman suggests that Western culture had been <em>en guarde</em> for signs of Orwellian oppression but has not adopted a defence against the possibility that our own ignorance may oppress ourselves.</p>
<section id="the-medium-is-the-metaphor" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-medium-is-the-metaphor">1. The Medium Is the Metaphor</h4>
<p>Postman argues that the technological revolution brought about by mass adoption of television has unwittingly changed the fabric of our society. Using the analogy of the clock, Postman indicates that the mechanism is not merely a device used for measuring time, but that it “dissociates time from human events and thus nourishes the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences.” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 12]</a></span>.</p>
<p>This analogy does not help someone who is subject to the belief of quantifiable sequence in understanding his point. The thought of a world without clocks is an unimaginable dystopia. The positives that the clock have wrought greatly outweigh any possible drawbacks that I can conceive of. This may be the point entirely - just as the fish is likely unaware that it lives within water, the ability of the human mind to conceive of how it has been influenced by a technology that has been fully integrated through society may be similarly limited.</p>
<p>Postman goes on to state that the clock has removed the concept of god from the meaning of time, so I am lost as to how to meaningfully rationalise his analogy. My takeaway is that a consequence of reducing the concept of time to the machinations of gears removes any sense of reverance or magical thought, although some would argue that the internals of an analogue clock are a thing of beauty and the trade of the watchmaker an art. Nonetheless the reduction of time to a gadget now worn on the wrist may have effects beyond a greater ability to manage time, possibly influencing our perception of our place in the universe. The comparison with television’s replacement of print seems to mean that there are unintended consequences owing to the adoption of a novel technology that are perhaps poorly understood.</p>
</section>
<section id="media-as-epistemology" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="media-as-epistemology">2. Media as Epistemology</h4>
<p>In this chapter, Postman considers the nature of truth, the acquirement of knowledge and how this has changed with the cultural trend toward visual media. The author posits the concept that all media are not equal in their ability to convey meaning and truth.</p>
<p>An interesting juxtaposition is explored - that in certain circumstances, the medium of spoken word is thought to be of higher merit than the written, such as in most modern courtrooms where verbal rather than written testimony is required. However, Postman is able to draw on his experience in academia to illustrate that the reverse is true in the assessment of a final year thesis, where a candidate had attempted to cite ephemereal evidence; a conversation or interview with an academic. In this example the result had been a witty retort from the review panel that:</p>
<p>“…we are sure you would prefer that this commission produce a written statement that you have passed your examination (should you do so) than for us merely to tell you that you have, and leave it at that. Our written statement would represent the”truth”. Our oral agreement would be only a rumour.” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 24]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Who could argue with that? Yet despite the passive aggression occasioned in academic assessment, the contrast between written and spoken discourse truth value may glaze over the context and purposes. The courtroom favours verbal testimony as an unadulterated recount of the past and motive, yet quickly commits this testimony to the written word via courtroom stenographers. An unfiltered account for a thesis would only serve as a draft and would require significant editing in order to test that the structure and content of the paper is robust.</p>
<p>Postman goes on to examine truth as a cultural prejudice for certain media. From tribal counsel’s use of parable through Aristotle’s deductive reasoning about the physical world. Postman rounds to the modern world’s adherance to the quantifiable.</p>
<p>“Many of our psychologists, sociologists, economists… will have numbers to tell them the truth or they will have nothing. Can you imagine, for example, a modern economist articulating truths about our standard of living by reciting a poem?” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 26]</a></span></p>
<p>While an entertaining diversion, I wonder if numbers can be considered a medium. It occurs to me that numbers are a language that can be expressed in a variety of media. An interesting perspective to be explored would have been the danger of an over-reliance on statistics as truth. The fact that statistics can be selectively deployed to make opposing arguments is of course, not a new one.</p>

<p>The use of numbers to oversimplify, diminish context and misdirect can also be a misuse of data visualisation.</p>
<p>“…it makes the viewer believe that they can see everything, all at once, from an imaginary and impossible standpoint. But it’s also a trick because what appears to be everything, and what appears to be neutral, is always … a partial perspective.” <span class="citation" data-cites="DataFeminism"><a href="#ref-DataFeminism" role="doc-biblioref">[2, Ch. 3]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps all of us are guilty of accepting a viewpoint based on the convincing support of charts or numbers, without undertaking the necessary due diligence of reproducing the analysis and seriously examining the null hypothesis.</p>

<section id="typographic-america" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="typographic-america">3. Typographic America</h4>
<p>The author uses this chapter to familiarise the reader with an abridged history of literacy from 17<sup>th</sup> century England and the United States to the modern day. Thanks primarily to the efforts of the churches, literacy among the general populace was understood to have been significantly higher than in the modern day populace. But with a decline in the relevance of the printed word, literacy rates have steadily declined over the previous century.</p>
<p>17<sup>th</sup> century people were conditioned to spend long hours of leisure time focussed upon reading a single book. This mental fortitude affected their ability and predeliction for other feats of mental endurance. Debating halls were common across the country and accounts of debates extending long into the evenings were said to be common. The contrast between these discussions and the modern approach to televised debates must be striking. It is here that I have little to argue with Postman’s position. It is undoubtedly true that television is a poor medium for long format discourse. In general, if a topic cannot be reduced to chunks of ten second soundbites, it generally makes for poor television.</p>
<p>While television is an enjoyable entertainment device, the demands of its format aim to keep the viewer perpetually stimulated and do not imbue its audience with mental fortitude. Postman’s position is that this lack of mental preparation against boredom leaves us struggling to achieve focus in many other contexts. These known limitations of television have given rise to the podcast format in recent years, where a type of long format debate has returned to public fora. Although whether this format will remain consistent in its aversion of advertisment as it grows remains to be seen.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-typographic-mind" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-typographic-mind">4. The Typographic Mind</h4>
<p>In this chapter the author explores how a sustained media shift away from the printed word may have influenced our assessment of culture’s interpretation of truth. The author compares the image-obsessed standards of the televised news shows to a form of infantilism. Where assessment of truth is based upon the appearance of the newscaster rather than the content of the televised message. An industry-wide <em>ad hominem</em> has permeated through even those shows that are intended to be sober and informative. Postman suggests that the form of truth and intelligence valued by ‘the typographic’ mind (pre-television) would have been markedly different.</p>
<p>An interesting point is made about an unspoken contract between television and those appearing on it. The author argues that the dominant media in our society governs the behaviours of those wishing to exploit that as a tool. How politicians, scholars and religious figures are reduced to a fickle celebrity by the demands of a television presence - curate your image, reduce your campaign to sound bites, prioritise speed over reason. In considering the first 15 presidents of the United States, Postman states,</p>
<p>“Public figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by their looks or even their oratory… To think about those men was to think about what they had written, to judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word.” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 70]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Recalling any of the notable icons of the twentieth century would entail recalling their image rather than the content of their words or actions. Political campaigns have been won and lost at the hands of advertisment budgets, party political broadcasts and impactful slogans. It appears that we are in the midst of fast food politics, a genereation of the slogan-oriented and averse to analysis of manifesto.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-peek-a-boo-world" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-peek-a-boo-world">5. The Peek-a-Boo World</h4>
<p>In The Peek-a-Boo World, the author establishes his concept of the “information -action ratio”, a novel concept considering the relevance of the communication a person is subject to.</p>
<p>“…how often does it occur that information provided you on morning radio or television, or in the morning newspaper, causes you to alter your plans for the day, or to take some action you would not otherwise have taken, or provides insight into some problem you are required to solve?” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 78]</a></span></p>
<p>The author goes on to qualify such exceptions as the weather and stock movements. It is an interesting concept and I have pondered the point, finding exceptions here and there, such as programmes that help people to manage their finances, special interest shows such as gardening series, so on. I can estimate how important shows such as <em>Songs of Praise</em> must be for those who are unable to participate in the communal observation of their religion in person. Undeniably, these shows would be exceptions that prove the rule - that the purpose of the television is primarily to entertain, even when it purports to inform.</p>
<p>Postman’s criticism of what has become “The News of the Day”, which he states started with the invention of the telegraph and has been further transformed by a partnership between television and modern newspapers into the ‘human interest’ genre, is that the information is low in information-action ratio. On the telegraph, “news from nowhere, addressed to no one in particular, began to criss-cross the nation” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 78]</a></span>.</p>
<p>This commodification of contextless information was bolstered by photography. Once papers adopted the photograph, “For countless Americans, seeing not reading, became the basis for believing” <span class="citation" data-cites="AOtD"><a href="#ref-AOtD" role="doc-biblioref">[1, p. 86]</a></span>. A prescient point as we enter the age of the deep fake.</p>
<p>The author’s point is that our culture is bombarded with low-relevance information. I identify with this argument in that I have found the combination of a negative news loop and continual outrage on social media to have caused a shift in my behaviour away from those media. Yet I also note that at the time of writing this blog, our country has experienced its largest sustained demonstration in hostory. The images and stories on the current war between Israel and Hamas have caused people across the country to consider their own position on the matter, arousing strong emotions that have led to these mass demonstrations. Similarly during the Covid-19 lockdowns, the greater part of the nation coalesced around the television to gain their news from the Covid press briefings. While the vast majority of television’s content may be almost irrelevant to those subject to it, its ability to influence thoughts and feelings on a mass scale may be magnified during crises.</p>
<p>I will complete my review of Part 1 on the warning that has troubled me the most. That TV-culture has become the dominant culture in a way that we can no longer separate the two.</p>
<p>“Twenty years ago, the question, does television shape culture or merely reflect it? held considerable interest for many scholars and social critics. The question has largely disappeared as television has gradually <em>become</em> our culture. This means, among other things, that we rarely talk about television…”</p>
<p>As fish are unaware of the water around them, we are immersed in TV culture and may be largely unaware of how this has mediated our thoughts. One could argue that the relevance of television is in decline and that newer forms of media are to dominate the future. I would argue that the addictive properties of the mobile phone tend to be those that ape features of television, but one that can follow you out of your living room, accompany you on your dog walk and keep you enthralled on your drive to work. It seems that the human predeliction for entertainment is all too capable of subjugating notions of personal safety.</p>
