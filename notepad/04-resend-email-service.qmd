## Sending Emails Without the Fuss

Recently needed to add email notifications to a web form—admin alerts and user confirmations. The thought of configuring an SMTP server made me wince. Then I found [Resend](https://resend.com).

## What Is It?

Resend is an email API for developers. Instead of wrestling with SMTP servers, mail transfer agents, and deliverability nightmares, you just... call an API.

```python
import resend

resend.api_key = "your-api-key"

resend.Emails.send({
    "from": "hello@yourdomain.com",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello!",
    "html": "<p>Your email body here</p>"
})
```

That's genuinely it.

## The Good Bits

- **No SMTP configuration** — No ports, no TLS certificates, no authentication headaches
- **Attachments are easy** — Pass base64 content or file paths
- **HTML emails just work** — Style them however you like
- **Generous free tier** — 3,000 emails/month at time of writing
- **Great dashboard** — See delivery status, bounces, opens
- **Vercel-friendly** — Works beautifully with serverless functions

## The Trade-offs

- **Vendor lock-in** — You're dependent on their service
- **Domain verification required** — Need to add DNS records for sending
- **Not self-hosted** — If that matters to your use case
- **Rate limits on free tier** — 100 emails/day limit

## My Use Case

For a membership form, I set up two email types:

1. **Admin notification** — HTML email with form data + CSV attachment
2. **Applicant confirmation** — Friendly receipt with next steps

Both fire when the form submits. If emails fail, the form submission still succeeds (data saved to DB), so nothing gets lost.

## Quick Tips

- Store `RESEND_API_KEY` in environment variables
- Always handle email failures gracefully—don't break your main flow
- The `from` address domain must be verified in your Resend dashboard
- CSV attachments need content as a list of bytes: `list(csv_content.encode())`

## Verdict

For hobby projects, internal tools, or MVPs where you just need email to work, Resend removes a lot of friction. Would reach for it again.
