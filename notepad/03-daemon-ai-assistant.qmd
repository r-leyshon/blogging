I've been fascinated by [Maggie Appleton's Language Model Sketchbook](https://maggieappleton.com/lm-sketchbook) for a while now. Her "Daemons" concept stuck with me — so I decided to build it.

## The Concept

What if AI assistants weren't chat windows, but *daemons* — little personalities that hover alongside your text, each with their own perspective?

- **Devil's Advocate** — questions your assertions, asks for evidence
- **Grammar Enthusiast** — spots style issues (purple, naturally)
- **Clarity Coach** — nudges toward clearer expression

The daemons highlight relevant sections and offer contextual suggestions as you write. It's a fundamentally different UX from the "type a prompt, wait for response" pattern we've all gotten used to.

## Try It

Here's the working prototype, click the daemon swatches to the right and they perform tasks, highlighting relevant blocks of text:

```{=html}
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
  <a href="https://daemon-ai-app.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open in new window ↗</a>
</p>
<div class="notepad-embed">
  <iframe 
  src="https://daemon-ai-app.vercel.app" 
  title="Daemon AI Assistant Demo">
  </iframe>
</div>

```

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore *alternative interfaces* for language models. The chat paradigm is powerful but it's not the only way. Maggie's original sketches proposed all sorts of ideas — daemons, word-level annotations, ambient suggestions.

Building this brought one of those ideas to life. It's rough around the edges, but that's the point of the notepad — showing work in progress.
