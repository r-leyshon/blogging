I'm genuinely blown away by Cursor's browser integration.

## What Changed

Previously, debugging web dev with an AI assistant meant:

- Manual screenshots → paste into chat
- Copy-pasting chunks of DOM
- Describing what you're seeing
- Back-and-forth "can you scroll down?"

Now? The agent just... *looks at the page*.

## The Toolkit

What I've been using:

- **`browser_navigate`** — point it at a URL
- **`browser_snapshot`** — accessibility tree, better than screenshots for reasoning
- **`browser_take_screenshot`** — visual capture when needed
- **`browser_click` / `browser_type`** — interact with elements directly
- **`browser_console_messages`** — inspect console logs without opening devtools
- **`browser_network_requests`** — see API calls, failed fetches, etc.
- **`browser_resize`** — test responsive layouts at different widths
- **`browser_wait_for`** — wait for text to appear/disappear or just pause

The console and network tools seem particularly powerful for debugging—no more "check your network tab" back-and-forth.

## Why It Matters

This feels like a genuine workflow shift. The agent can now:

1. Navigate to your running dev server
2. Visually verify changes
3. Inspect the DOM structure
4. Catch console errors
5. Iterate on fixes
