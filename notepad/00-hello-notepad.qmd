In the age of the LLM revolution, I'm currently unsure as to how useful long form blogging will be. 

While I weigh things up, I will go with a demonstrably scruffy and minimal approach to recording ideas, experiments and snippets for things that I've found interesting, tricky or non-trivial.

Some of these ideas may be re-touched with time or grow into fully fledged articles, while others may remain as limited records of stuff done.
